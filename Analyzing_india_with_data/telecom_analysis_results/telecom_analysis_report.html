    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>The telecommunications market in India showed significant growth during the analysis period, with the private sector demonstrating stronger performance and gaining market share. This suggests a trend toward privatization and increased competition in the industry.</p>
    
    <p>The analysis reveals clear seasonal patterns in growth rates, which can be valuable for strategic planning. The correlation between public and private sector metrics indicates that while they compete for market share, they are influenced by similar external factors.</p>
