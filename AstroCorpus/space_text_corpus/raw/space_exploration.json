Now it’s time to test a similar…\n\nThe NASA Technology Transfer program ensures that innovations developed for exploration and discovery are broadly available to the public, maximizing the benefit to the nation. NASA ensures inventions for space find practical uses closer to home. They often become solutions to different challenges – ones we didn’t set out to solve. Called NASA spinoffs, these technologies benefit life on Earth in the form of commercial products.\n\nThe path to the Moon, Mars, and beyond requires technologies to get us where we need to go quickly, safely and efficiently. Space travel includes launch and in-space propulsion systems, cryogenic fluid management, and thermal management, as well as navigation and landing systems to get our supplies, equipment, and robotic or human explorers to diverse surface destinations.\n\nTechnologies for living in space enable our robotic and human explorers to achieve their mission goals. This means everything from having power to do their work, to the habitats or spacecraft they’ll call home. Our astronauts also need technologies to make food and eat, exercise, sleep and maintain their overall wellbeing.\n\nAdvanced manufacturing technologies for both terrestrial and in-space purposes will make commercial and exploration missions more efficient and affordable. We’re developing new materials with improved or combined properties, learning how to build infrastructure and innovating on manufacturing processes.\n\nNASA uses robotic systems to explore other planets and objects in our solar system as precursors to crewed missions, assist astronauts on the International Space Station, study the universe, and much more. This also includes autonomous systems that enable robotics, spacecraft and aircraft to operate in a dynamic environment independent of external control.\n\nScience instruments are state-of-the-art tools for acquiring information about planetary geology, atmosphere, and environmental conditions. This includes technologies for remote sensing, mapping and observation capabilities, analyzing light from the universe, and even searching for signs of life.\n\nSpace-qualified computing technology is designed to address the most computationally-intensive part of a mission. But for the future, NASA is going to need more power and more processing capabilities. We also work on modeling and simulation tech, software, and unique electronics and computing hardware for flight systems, whether in space or the atmosphere.\n\nReliable space communication systems are critical to every NASA mission. Spacecraft commands, never-before-seen images, and scientific data are sent and received daily by NASA's giant antennas on Earth. From the Voyager mission exploring beyond our solar system, to astronauts onboard the International Space Station, space communications provide the crucial connection to our home planet.\n\nNASA selected 60 winning teams for the second TechRise Student Challenge, a nationwide contest designed to engage students in technology, science, and space exploration.

    "date": "",
    "content": "3 min read\n\nNASA is seeking design ideas from global creators for a zero gravity indicator that will fly aboard the agency’s Artemis II test flight. Zero gravity indicators are small, plush items carried aboard spacecraft to provide a visual indication of when the spacecraft and its crew reach space.\n\nThis opportunity, with a submission deadline of May 27, asks for original designs representing the significance of NASA’s Artemis campaign, the mission, or exploration and discovery, and meet specific requirements for materials and size.\n\n“What better way to fly a mission around the Moon than to invite the public inside NASA’s Orion spacecraft with us and ask for help in designing our zero gravity indicator?” asked Reid Wiseman, NASA astronaut and Artemis II commander, at the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. “The indicator will float alongside Victor, Christina, Jeremy, and me as we go around the far side of the Moon and remind us of all of you back on Earth.”\n\nUp to 25 finalists, including from a K-12 student division, will be selected. The Artemis II crew will choose one design that NASA’s Thermal Blanket Lab will fabricate to fly alongside them in Orion. Imagine seeing your creation floating weightlessly with astronauts on their way around the Moon.\n\nFor complete contest details, visit:\n\nhttp://www.freelancer.com/moon-mascot\n\nCrowdsourcing company Freelancer is hosting the challenge, called Moon Mascot: NASA Artemis II ZGI Design Contest, on behalf of the agency through the NASA Tournament Lab, managed by the agency’s Space Technology Mission Directorate.\n\nNASA has a long history of flying zero gravity indicators for human spaceflight missions. Many missions to the International Space Station include a plush item. A plush Snoopy rode inside Orion during NASA’s uncrewed Artemis I mission.\n\nArtemis II will be the first test flight of the Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft, and supporting ground system with crew aboard. NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch, and CSA (Canadian Space Agency) astronaut Jeremy Hansen will venture around the Moon and back. The mission is the first crewed flight under NASA’s Artemis campaign and is another step toward missions on the lunar surface and helping the agency prepare for future human missions to Mars.\n\nAll major elements for Artemis II are readying for flight. Engineers recently completed stacking the twin solid rocket boosters for the SLS (Space Launch System) on their launch platform and are preparing for integration of the SLS core stage in the coming weeks. Teams also recently installed the solar array wings on the Orion spacecraft that will carry the four astronauts on their journey around the Moon and home.\n\nThrough Artemis, NASA will send astronauts to explore the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and build the foundation for the first crewed missions to Mars.\n\nLearn more about Artemis II at:\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/\n\n-end-\n\nRachel KraftHeadquarters, Washington202-358-1600rachel.h.kraft@nasa.gov\n\nCourtney BeasleyJohnson Space Center, Houston281-483-5111courtney.m.beasley@nasa.gov"

The SPHEREx astrophysics mission will search the galaxy and take stock.\n\nEvery living organism on Earth needs water to survive, so scientists searching for life outside our solar system, are often guided by the phrase “follow the water.” Scheduled to launch no earlier than Thursday, Feb. 27, NASA’s SPHEREx (Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer) mission will help in that quest.\n\nAfter its ride aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 from Vandenberg Space Force base in California, the observatory will search for water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and other key ingredients for life frozen on the surface of interstellar dust grains in the clouds of gas and dust where planets and stars eventually form.\n\nWhile there are no oceans or lakes floating freely in space, scientists think these reservoirs of ice, bound to small dust grains, are where most of the water in our universe forms and resides. Additionally, the water in Earth’s oceans as well as those of other planets and moons in our galaxy likely originated in such locations.\n\nThe mission will focus on massive regions of gas and dust called molecular clouds. Within those, SPHEREx will also look at some newly formed stars and the disks of material around them from which new planets are born.\n\nAlthough space telescopes such as NASA’s James Webb and retired Spitzer have detected water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and other compounds in hundreds of targets, the SPHEREx observatory is the first to be uniquely equipped to conduct a large-scale survey of the galaxy in search of water ice and other frozen compounds.\n\nRather than taking 2D images of a target like a star, SPHEREx will gather 3D data along its line of sight. That enables scientists to see the amount of ice present in a molecular cloud and observe how the composition of the ices throughout the cloud changes in different environments.\n\nBy making more than 9 million of these line-of-sight observations and creating the largest-ever survey of these materials, the mission will help scientists better understand how these compounds form on dust grains and how different environments can influence their abundance.\n\nIt makes sense that the composition of planets and stars would reflect the molecular clouds they formed in. However, researchers are still working to confirm the specifics of the planet formation process, and the universe doesn’t always match scientists’ expectations.\n\nFor example, a NASA mission launched in 1998, the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite (SWAS), surveyed the galaxy for water in gas form — including in molecular clouds — but found far less than expected.\n\n“This puzzled us for a while,” said Gary Melnick, a senior astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian and a member of the SPHEREx science team. “We eventually realized that SWAS had detected gaseous water in thin layers near the surface of molecular clouds, suggesting that there might be a lot more water inside the clouds, locked up as ice.”\n\nThe mission team’s hypothesis also made sense because SWAS detected less oxygen gas (two oxygen atoms bound together) than expected. They concluded that the oxygen atoms were sticking to interstellar dust grains, and were then joined by hydrogen atoms, forming water. Later research confirmed this. What’s more, the clouds shield molecules from cosmic radiation that would otherwise break those compounds apart. As a result, water ice and other materials stored deep in a cloud’s interior are protected.\n\nAs starlight passes through a molecular cloud, molecules like water and carbon dioxide block certain wavelengths of light, creating a distinct signature that SPHEREx and other missions like Webb can identify using a technique called absorption spectroscopy.\n\nIn addition to providing a more detailed accounting of the abundance of these frozen compounds, SPHEREx will help researchers answer questions including how deep into molecular clouds ice begins to form, how the abundance of water and other ices changes with the density of a molecular cloud, and how that abundance changes once a star forms.\n\nAs a survey telescope, SPHEREx is designed to study large portions of the sky relatively quickly, and its results can be used in conjunction with data from targeted telescopes like Webb, which observe a significantly smaller area but can see their targets in greater detail.\n\n“If SPHEREx discovers a particularly intriguing location, Webb can study that target with higher spectral resolving power and in wavelengths that SPHEREx cannot detect,” said Melnick. “These two telescopes could form a highly effective partnership.”\n\nSPHEREx is managed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California for the Astrophysics Division within the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. BAE Systems (formerly Ball Aerospace) built the telescope and the spacecraft bus. The science analysis of the SPHEREx data will be conducted by a team of scientists located at 10 institutions in the U.S., two in South Korea, and one in Taiwan. Data will be processed and archived at IPAC at Caltech, which manages JPL for NASA. The mission principal investigator is based at Caltech with a joint JPL appointment.

    "content": "8 min read\n\nNASA’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission with agency astronauts Nick Hague, Butch Wilmore, and Suni Williams, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov is preparing to return to Earth following their science mission aboard the International Space Station. Hague, Williams, and Wilmore completed more than 900 hours of research between more than 150 unique scientific experiments and technology demonstrations during their stay aboard the orbiting laboratory.\n\nHere’s a look at some scientific milestones accomplished during their journey:\n\nNASA astronaut Nick Hague processes samples for Arthrospira C, an investigation from ESA (European Space Agency) that transplants and grows Arthrospiramicro-algae aboard the International Space Station. These organisms conduct photosynthesis and could be used to convert carbon dioxide exhaled by crew members into oxygen, helping maintain a safe atmosphere inside spacecraft. Arthrospira also could provide fresh food on long-duration space missions.\n\nResearchers are testing the European Enhanced Exploration Exercise Device (E4D), a modular device that combines cycling, rowing, and resistance exercises to help keep crews healthy on long-duration missions. A single, small device effective at countering bone and muscle loss and improving cardiovascular health could help crew on future missions. NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore works on installing the device aboard the International Space Station ahead of its evaluation.\n\nThis red romaine lettuce growing in the International Space Station’s Advanced Plant Habitat is part of Plant Habitat-07, a study of how different moisture levels affect the microbial communities in plants and water. Results could show how less-than-ideal conditions affect plant growth and help scientists design systems to produce safe and nutritious food for crew members on future space journeys.\n\nPacked bed reactors are systems that “pack” materials such as pellets or beads inside a structure to increase contact between any liquids and gasses flowing through it. NASA astronaut Suni Williams installs hardware for the Packed Bed Reactor Experiment: Water Recovery Series (PBRE-WRS) investigation, which examines how gravity affects these systems aboard the International Space Station. Results could help scientists design better reactors for water recovery, thermal management, fuel cells, and other applications.\n\nDuring the Residence Time Driven Flame Spread (SOFIE-RTDFS) investigation at the International Space Station, this sheet of clear acrylic plastic burns at higher oxygen levels and half the standard pressure of Earth’s atmosphere. From left to right, the image sequence shows a side and top view of the fuel and the oxygen slowly diffusing into the flame. Studying the spread of flames in microgravity could help improve safety on future missions.\n\nDuring a recent spacewalk, NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore swabbed the exterior of the International Space Station for ISS External Microorganisms, an investigation exploring whether microorganisms leave the spacecraft through its vents and, if so, which ones survive. Humans carry microorganisms along with them wherever they go, and this investigation could help scientists take steps to limit microbial spread to places like the Moon and Mars.\n\nNASA astronaut Nick Hague exercises on the International Space Station’s Advanced Resistive Exercise Device while wearing the Bio-Monitor vest and headband. This set of garments contains sensors that unobtrusively collect data such as heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure, and temperature. The data supports studies on human health, including Vascular Aging, a CSA (Canadian Space Agency) investigation that monitors cardiovascular function in space.\n\nNASA astronaut Butch Wilmore works with hardware for InSPA Auxilium Bioprinter, a study that tests 3D printing of an implantable medical device that could facilitate recovery from peripheral nerve damage, a type of injury that can cause sensory and motor issues. In microgravity, this manufacturing technique produces higher-quality devices that may perform better, benefitting crew members on future long-duration missions and patients back home.\n\nA deployer attached to the International Space Station’s Kibo laboratory module launches LignoSat into space. Developed by JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), the satellite tests using wood as a more sustainable alternative to conventional satellite materials. Researchers previously exposed different woods to space and chose magnolia as the best option for the study, including sensors to evaluate the wood’s strain and its response to temperature and radiation. Researchers also are monitoring whether Earth’s geomagnetic field interferes with the satellite’s data transmission.\n\nNASA astronaut Suni Williams poses with bacteria and yeast samples for Rhodium Biomanufacturing 03, part of an ongoing examination of microgravity’s effects on biomanufacturing engineered bacteria and yeast aboard the International Space Station. Microgravity causes changes in microbial cell growth, cell structure, and metabolic activity that can affect biomanufacturing processes. This investigation could clarify the extent of these effects and advance the use of microbes to make food, pharmaceuticals, and other products in space, reducing the cost of launching equipment and consumables from Earth.\n\nThe International Space Station’s Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer, or NICER, studies neutron stars, the glowing cinders left behind when massive stars explode as supernovas. NASA astronaut Nick Hague installs patches during a spacewalk to repair damage to thermal shields that block out sunlight while allowing X-rays to pass through. The instrument continues to generate astrophysics discoveries reported in hundreds of scientific papers.\n\nFrom inside the International Space Station’s cupola, NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore photographs landmarks on Earth approximately 260 miles (418 kilometers) below. Crew members have taken millions of images of Earth from the space station for Crew Earth Observations, creating one of the longest-running records of how our planet changes over time. These images support a variety of research, including studies of phenomena such as flooding and fires, atmospheric processes affected by volcanic eruptions, urban growth, and land use.\n\nThis photograph captures an orbital sunrise above the lights of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo as the International Space Station orbits above Brazil. This image is one of the millions of photographs taken by crew members for Crew Earth Observations. These images teach us more about our home planet, and studies show that taking them improves the mental well-being of crew members. Many spend much of their free time pursuing shots that, like this one, are only possible from space.\n\nThe BioNutrients investigation demonstrates technology to produce nutrients during long-duration space missions using engineered microbes like yeast. Food stored for long periods can lose vitamins and other nutrients, and this technology could provide a way to make supplements on demand. NASA astronaut Suni Williams prepares specially designed growth packets for the investigation aboard the International Space Station.\n\nThe International Space Station’s robotic hand, Dextre, attached to the Canadarm2 robotic arm, moves hardware into position for the COronal Diagnostic EXperiment, or CODEX. This investigation examines solar wind and how it forms using a solar coronagraph, which blocks out bright light from the Sun to reveal details in its outer atmosphere or corona. Results could help scientists understand the heating and acceleration of the solar wind and provide insight into the source of the energy that generates it.\n\nRoscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov conducts a hearing test in the relative quiet of the International Space Station’s Quest airlock. Crew members often serve as test subjects for research on how spaceflight affects hearing and vision, the immune and cardiovascular systems, and other bodily functions. This research supports the development of ways to prevent or mitigate these effects.\n\nEuro Material Ageing, an ESA (European Space Agency) investigation, studies how certain materials age when exposed to the harsh space environment. Findings could advance design for spacecraft and satellites, including improved thermal control, as well as the development of sensors for research and industrial applications. NASA astronaut Suni Williams installs the experiment into the Nanoracks Bishop airlock for transport to the outside of the International Space Station.\n\nNASA astronauts Don Pettit and Butch Wilmore remove a small satellite deployer from an airlock on the International Space Station. The deployer had released several CubeSats into Earth orbit including CySat-1, a remote sensor that measures soil moisture, and DORA, a receiver that could provide affordable and accurate communications among small spacecraft.\n\nThe Responsive Engaging Arms for Captive Care and Handling demonstration (Astrobee REACCH) uses the International Space Station’s Astrobee robots to test technology for capturing objects of any geometry or material orbiting in space. This ability could enable satellite servicing and movement to maximize the lifespan of these tools and removal of space debris that could damage satellites providing services to the people of Earth. NASA astronaut Suni Williams checks out an Astrobee fitted with tentacle-like arms and adhesive pads for the investigation.\n\nAs part of a program called High school students United with NASA to Create Hardware, or HUNCH, NASA astronaut Nick Hague demonstrates the HUNCH Utility Bracket, a student-designed tool to hold and position cameras, tablets, and other equipment that astronauts use daily. Currently, crew members on the International Space Station use devices called Bogen Arms, which have experienced wear and tear and need to be replaced.\n\nThe SpaceX Dragon spacecraft fires its thrusters after undocking from the International Space Station as it flies 260 miles (418 kilometers) above the Pacific Ocean west of Hawaii. NASA’s commercial resupply services deliver critical scientific studies, hardware, and supplies to the station.\n\nSpace Station Research and Technology\n\nHumans In Space\n\nStation Benefits for Humanity\n\nInternational Space Station News"

    "date": "March 7, 2025",
    "content": "Beth Ridgeway\n\nBy Wayne Smith\n\nYou don’t want to sleep on this upcoming lunar event.\n\nJust step outside on the evening of March 13 or early in the morning of March 14 and take a look at the total lunar eclipse for yourself. And you can count NASA’s Dr. Renee Weber among those who will be checking it out – weather permitting and sleep not withstanding.\n\n“As a child I remember begging my mom to wake me up to see a lunar eclipse,” said Weber, the chief scientist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. “The next morning I was mad because she didn’t wake me up – except she DID, but because I was so sleepy I don’t have any memories of it! Fortunately I’ve gotten a few chances to see lunar eclipses as an adult, including the one that occurred on Jan. 20, 2019, which I also photographed.”\n\nGiven its nickname, a Blood Moon may not sound as appealing as a Blue Moon or Harvest Moon. But this one lives up to its name – at least when it comes to its potentially deep red color during a total lunar eclipse.\n\nA lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align so that the Moon passes into Earth’s shadow. In a total lunar eclipse, the entire Moon falls within the darkest part of Earth’s shadow, called the umbra. When the Moon is within the umbra, it appears red-orange. Lunar eclipses are sometimes called “Blood Moons” because of this phenomenon.\n\nIn Huntsville, the eclipse will begin in partial phases at 10:57 p.m. on March 13, and end at 5:00 a.m. on March 14. Totality will begin at 1:26 a.m. and end at 2:31, with maximum eclipse occurring at 1:58. View more information on times to observe the eclipse in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n“With March being a pretty typical month for spring showers, there’s roughly a 50/50 chance it’ll be cloudy, so keep a close eye on the weather forecast leading up to the eclipse,” Weber said. “That totality will last for close to an hour, so even if it’s cloudy you may still be able to glimpse it if the clouds are scattered.”\n\nDr. Renee Weber\n\nChief Scientist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center\n\nNo special equipment is needed if the clouds cooperate. And moving away from bright lights will give you a better view, as will binoculars.\n\nWhy does the Moon turn that odd shade of red? According to NASA, some of the sunlight passing through Earth’s atmosphere reaches the Moon’s surface, lighting it dimly. Colors with shorter wavelengths – the blues and violets – scatter more easily than colors with longer wavelengths, like red and orange. Because these longer wavelengths make it through Earth’s atmosphere, and the shorter wavelengths have scattered away, the Moon appears orange or reddish during a lunar eclipse. The more dust or clouds in Earth’s atmosphere during the eclipse, the redder the Moon appears.\n\nThe total lunar eclipse has already garnered lots of media attention. Weber hopes such events creates more public interest in learning more about the Moon and NASA missions.\n\n“The Moon is a unique part of the human experience, and sharing it with others has always been my passion,” she said. “I’m so excited by NASA’s focus on lunar exploration, by astronauts with the Artemis missions, robotic landers through the Commercial Lunar Payload Service initiative, and with currently-operating spacecraft like the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. These missions will allow us to make continued scientific discoveries that inspire the nation and the world.”\n\nVisit NASA’s What’s Up guide for monthly skywatching tips, and find lunar observing recommendations for each day of the year in the agency’s Daily Moon Guide.\n\nLane FigueroaMarshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.256.544.0034 lane.e.figueroa@nasa.gov\n\nBeth Ridgeway"

    "date": "6 March 2025",
    "content": "The first-ever private asteroid mission appears to be over, just a week or so after it left the ground.\n\nCalifornia startup AstroForge launched its Odin spacecraft on Feb. 26, on the same SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that sent Intuitive Machines' IM-2 mission toward the moon. Odin ran into trouble just a few hours later, however, and AstroForge has pretty much given up hope of recovering the 265-pound (120-kilogram) probe.\n\n\"The chance of talking with Odin is minimal, as at this point, the accuracy of its position is becoming an issue,\" the company wrote in an update today (March 6).\n\nAstroForge built Odin in less than 10 months, spending just $3.5 million to do so — a fraction of what a similar government-funded space probe would cost.\n\n\"This rapid-iteration approach embodies our philosophy: learn fast, adjust quickly and accept calculated risks to gain experience that can't be acquired through simulation or planning alone,\" the company wrote in today's update.\n\nRelated: 'I think we all know that hope is fading.' Private Odin asteroid probe is tumbling in space\n\nOdin was supposed to fly by a small near-Earth asteroid named 2022 OB5 to collect imagery and other data about the space rock. This was meant to pave the way for a future mission, dubbed Vestri, that AstroForge hopes to land on 2022 OB5. Eventually, AstroForge plans to mine 2022 OB5 and other space rocks, extracting valuable resources such as platinum-group metals.\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!\n\nOdin deployed from its Falcon 9 rocket on schedule on Feb. 26, but AstroForge had difficulty establishing sustained communications with the spacecraft — a problem that persists.\n\nThe company now has some ideas about what went wrong.\n\n\"Our leading theory involves potential complications with solar panel deployment. Odin booted up into a Sun Safe Mode — a protective state designed to conserve power while attempting to re-orient toward the sun,\" AstroForge wrote in today's update.\n\n\"If the panels didn't fully extend and lock, Odin would operate with severely limited power, prioritizing essential systems over communication, periodically attempting to deploy panels and stabilize position,\" the company added. \"How long Odin can stay in this mode before losing power and tumbling depends on how much power the panels are able to generate in this off-nominal situation — from 2.5 hours to indefinitely.\"\n\nIt's also possible that Odin is tumbling through space, which would prohibit its antenna from locking on to Earth.\n\n\"If tumbling is occurring, we might expect occasional brief communications when the antenna happens to align with Earth —precisely the pattern we observed early in the mission,\" AstroForge wrote.\n\n\n\nTracking data shows that Odin is continuing along its planned trajectory. The probe is currently about 270,000 miles (435,000 kilometers) from Earth, meaning it has gone beyond the moon.\n\n\"This places our spacecraft in truly deep space territory — an achievement few private companies can claim,\" AstroForge wrote.\n\nThe company will try re-establishing contact with Odin from time to time, according to today's update. But, the company added, \"our focus has shifted to applying these hard-won insights to our next mission. The data we did receive, though limited, has proven invaluable in understanding the challenges of deep space communication and spacecraft operation.\n\n\"In many ways, Odin has become both a pioneer and a teacher — continuing its mission by informing our future endeavors, even in silence.\"\n\n—  SpaceX rocket launches private moon lander and NASA 'trailblazer' to hunt for lunar water (video)\n\n— Space mining company AstroForge identifies asteroid target for Odin launch next month\n\n— Space mining startup AstroForge aims to launch historic asteroid-landing mission in 2025\n\nAstroForge has been very busy since its founding in 2022. The company launched its first spacecraft, a cubesat called Brokkr-1, on a Falcon 9 in April 2023 to test prototype refinery technology. Brokkr-1 reached orbit successfully but was unable to switch its payload on.\n\nNext up for AstroForge is Vestri, which is scheduled to launch along with Intuitive Machines' IM-3 moon-landing mission in late 2026 or early 2027.\n\nVestri will be much larger than Odin, tipping the scales here on Earth at 440 pounds (200 kg). Vestri will also feature landing legs, because it will attempt to touch down on 2022 OB5 and get an up-close assessment of the asteroid's platinum-group metal abundance.\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

    "title": "Life as we don't know it: Some aliens may need sulfuric acid like we need water",
    "date": "20 February 2025",
    "content": "Life as we know it needs water, but life as we don't know it may run on concentrated sulfuric acid.\n\nThe chemistry of life as we know it wouldn't work in a place like the huge Saturn moon Titan, where it's so cold that ice behaves more like rock, or in the acidic clouds of Venus. But a different chemistry, which built all the requisite pieces out of different materials, might have a shot. Imagine cells that use methane, sulfuric acid, or even molten rock the way your cells use water.\n\nAccording to a 2021 study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) molecular biologist William Bains and his colleagues, it turns out that, if we're looking for life as we don't know it, the best solvent out there may be concentrated sulfuric acid — the stuff that's floating around in the clouds of Venus.\n\nAt the most basic level, life is just a series of chemical reactions. Those reactions need a medium in which to occur, which chemists call a solvent: something fluid enough that molecules can float around and mingle, and there needs to be a lot of it in one place. But not just any liquid will do; a solvent also needs to help break down and transport the chemicals that cells need to live — without also dissolving important molecules like lipids and amino acids.\n\nRelated: Alien life could thrive in Venus' acidic clouds, new study hints\n\nHere on Earth, water fits the bill perfectly, but it may not be the only liquid in the universe capable of supporting the chemistry of life. In a new study, Bains and his colleagues rated several possible solvents based on how they interact with the chemical building blocks of life and how common they should be on rocky planets.\n\nCandidates ranged from the liquid forms of methane and ethane, ammonia and carbon dioxide to even stranger possibilities like pitch and molten rock. The surprising champion is a chemical we Earthlings think of as painfully hostile to life: concentrated sulfuric acid.\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!\n\n\"Even very complex organic chemistry is compatible with concentrated sulfuric acid,\" MIT astrobiologist Janusz Petkowski, a co-author of the new study, which was published in December in the journal Astrobiology, told Space.com.\n\nTitan's frigid lakes of methane have been a hotspot for speculation about life as we don't know it ever since NASA's Cassini Saturn orbiter sent home the first photos of them in 2005. Methane and ethane are gases at the temperatures we find here on Earth; to condense into the liquid that fills the dark seas of Titan, they need temperatures around minus 250 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 157 Celsius). But in such extreme cold, atoms and molecules move sluggishly, so chemical reactions happen in slow motion — far too slowly for life to happen, according to Petkowski.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, molten rock is out because the tremendous heat required to keep rock liquid also breaks down nearly all organic molecules.\n\nSome chemicals, like ammonia, have all the right properties to make good solvents for life's chemistry to happen in. But that may not matter, because the same processes that equip a rocky planet with ammonia are also likely to stock it with water, and when that happens, the two substances almost inevitably mix. That's an interesting prospect for life in its own right, because ammonia lowers the freezing point of water, which opens up a wider range of places where life could survive the cold.\n\n\"While ammonia may play a bigger role in an exoplanet biochemistry than it does on Earth,\" Bains and his colleagues wrote in their recent paper, \"It is unlikely to be a solvent in its own right.\"\n\nSo, if astrobiologists ever do find alien life with a weird chemistry that uses some liquid other than water, it's not likely to be methane, ammonia, or molten rock — but somewhere out there, alien life just might have cells filled with pure sulfuric acid.\n\nBased on physics models of how solar systems form, sulfuric acid should be fairly common on rocky planets like Venus, and it's definitely good at dissolving things. But surprisingly, some of the most important building blocks for life — things like amino acids and lipids — can float around and do chemistry in pure sulfuric acid just as easily as they can in water.\n\n\"Classically, [sulfuric acid] is not seen as a great solvent [for life],\" Dirk Schulze-Makuch, an astrobiologist at the Technical University of Berlin who was not involved in the recent study, told Space.com. \"However, Bains and co-authors showed that an amazingly large number and various types of organics are stable in concentrated sulfuric acid. That was quite surprising.\"\n\nPetkowski participated in some recent experiments that found that some peptides (short chains of amino acids) were actually stable in concentrated sulfuric acid for months on end — so stable that eventually the researchers just got bored with the measurements, according to Petkowski. Earlier experiments found that 19 out of the 20 amino acids that form proteins in the human body don't dissolve in concentrated sulfuric acid. And a study that's still awaiting peer review found that not only can lipids (the molecules that make up our cell membranes) withstand concentrated sulfuric acid, they actually start to form tiny fluid-filled sacs that look a lot like vesicles, the precursors of membranes.\n\nHow does that happen? Strangely, the key is water. Sulfuric acid on Earth is usually found mixed with water, not in its pure form; it's really water with some acid in it. And in that mixture, sulfuric acid catalyzes chemical reactions between water and the bonds that hold peptides together. Take away either the water or the acid, and those reactions can't happen — so peptides are stable in either solvent, but not in a mixture of the two.\n\n\"Concentrated sulfuric acid is a very different substance from diluted acid,\" said Petkowski. \"It is a common misconception that sulfuric acid destroys all organic chemistry. This is wrong. It is a very aggressive solvent, but it is very aggressive to specific parts in organic molecules, like sugars.\" (For all its mildness to amino acids and lipids, sulfuric acid will absolutely destroy sugars, which make up a lot of the scaffolding on which life is built.)\n\nSomewhere in the universe, sulfuric acid lakes could be teeming with life forms whose basic chemistry is only a little different from ours.\n\nRelated: The search for alien life\n\n— What if life on Venus is just life from Earth?\n\n— Life on Venus? Why it's not an absurd thought\n\n— Does alien life need a planet to survive? Scientists propose intriguing possibility\n\nAlien life forms that use sulfuric acid in place of water would probably look surprisingly similar to Earth life, with some subtle but important differences in their chemical makeup.\n\n\"We should understand sulfuric acid as an environment that is not so alien as we think it is,\" said Petkowski. (That doesn't mean you can safely swim in concentrated sulfuric acid; your cells did not evolve for that. Please do not test it.)\n\nFor example, life in a sulfuric acid sea would have to use something sturdier in place of sugars, which disintegrate very quickly in sulfuric acid. On Earth, sugars are how cells store energy, and they also make up parts of cell walls. Aliens on Venus would use some other type of molecule to do the same things without falling apart.\n\n\"You have to adapt your organic chemistry to the solvent,\" said Petkowski. \"You have to choose the chemical LEGO building blocks properly, but you can arrive with functionally the same structures at the end.\"\n\nOther differences might be more subtle. Concentrated sulfuric acid doesn't break down most of the amino acids our bodies use, but it does cause small changes in their \"side chains,\" strings of atoms that stick out from the molecule like a tail. And just a single chemical bond makes the difference between a peptide that's stable in sulfuric acid and one that breaks down. So aliens on an acidic world could still have cells made of amino acids and proteins, but they might look just a tiny bit different than ours.\n\nThe membranes that surround cells — keeping the chemical mechanisms of life inside and everything else outside — may look strikingly familiar, though. Those vesicle-like globules that appeared when Petkowski and his colleagues put lipids into sulfuric acid actually formed in exactly the same way that vesicles form in water: a process called pearling. First, the lipids form tubes, and then those tubes break apart into little vesicles. Life on an acidic world might use a different set of lipids than the ones in our cell membranes, but the physics of membrane formation would look the same, if Petkowski and his colleagues are right.\n\nAstrobiologists like Petkowski, Schulze-Makuch, and others still aren't exactly sure how all the pieces of life as we don't know it might come together. But, as Petkowski pointed out, they're also not sure how a few groups of molecules here on Earth made the leap from chemistry to life.\n\n\"We are as far away from figuring out [the] origin of life in water as we are in concentrated sulfuric acid,\" Petkowski said.\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

Read our full wrap on the Starship Flight 8 launch and see stunning video of the Starship reentry over the Bahamas.\n\nSpaceX is again poised to launch its latest Starship megarocket on a test flight that will also attempt to catch the world's largest rocket booster with giant metal chopsticks. If you want to watch it live, we've got details on when and how to see it.\n\nAfter a now three-day delay, SpaceX's Starship Flight 8 test is now currently scheduled to launch no earlier than Thursday, March 6, at 6:30 p.m. EST (2330 GMT) from SpaceX's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. This mission will mark SpaceX's eighth test flight of the giant rocket and is the first launch since an anomaly destroyed SpaceX's Flight 7 Starship spacecraft, which was doomed by fires that led to its destruction during ascent in January.\n\nYou'll be able to watch the Starship Flight 8 launch live on Space.com, courtesy of SpaceX, in a livestream expected to begin shortly about 40 minutes before liftoff. Follow our Starship live updates for more on the flight and read on for exact timing information that we've collected.\n\nCurrently, SpaceX is aiming for a 6:30 p.m. EST liftoff time on March 6 for the Starship Flight 8 launch. The company originally tried to launch Flight 8 on Monday, but encountered undisclosed Booster and Ship issues to that prompted SpaceX to call off the launch attempt with less than a minute left in the countdown.\n\nThe company has not listed a specific window for the launch, but the company's Flight 6 test included a 30-minute window. If a similar window is set for Flight 8, the launch could occur anytime between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. EST (2330 to 0000 GMT).\n\nThe launch date could change in the next few days, so be sure to check back here for any updates. SpaceX has already postponed the flight once. An initial announcement by the company included a Friday (Feb. 28) launch target, with the company pushing the flight back three more days without listing a reason before the latest delay. After the March 3 launch scrub, SpaceX initially rescheduled Starship Flight 8 tolaunch on March 5, but on that day the company shifted it back another 24 hours to March 6.\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!\n\n\n\nStarship Die Cast Rocket Model Now $47.99 on Amazon.\n\nIf you can't see SpaceX's Starship in person, you can score a model of your own. Standing at 13.77 inches (35 cm), this is a 1:375 ratio of SpaceX's Starship as a desktop model. The materials here are alloy steel and it weighs just 225g.\n\nSpaceX's Starship launch system is the world's tallest and most powerful rocket. Designed to be fully resuable, it stands about 400 feet tall (122 meters) and is made up of a giant Super Heavy booster with 33 Raptor engines on its first stage that is topped with a Ship upper stage powered by six Raptor vacuum engines.\n\nThe most recent Starship launch was SpaceX's Flight 7 test flight on Jan. 16, which marked the first flight of a new version of Starship, but the Ship vehicle was lost during ascent due to a propellant leak. It rained debris over the Atlantic Ocean near the Turks and Caicos islands just over 8 minutes after launch.\n\nRelated: Read our SpaceX Starship and Super Heavy guide for a detailed look\n\nThe first Starship test, Flight 1, launched in April 2023, with SpaceX reaching space for the first time with Flight 3 in March 2024. In October 2024, SpaceX captured its first Super Heavy booster with the metal \"chopsticks\" arms of its Mechazilla gantry on Flight 5, a feat the company repeated on Flight 7 last month.\n\nIf you can't get to South Texas and are worried about missing SpaceX's Flight 8 launch, have no fear. You'll be able to watch it live online using one of several livestreams and webcasts that will chronicle the mission. Space.com will even simulcast SpaceX's livestream in real time here and on our homepage.\n\nSpaceX's Starship Flight 8 webcast will stream live on the company's X social media account , as well as its Flight 8 mission page. The livestream should begin about 40 minutes before liftoff, at 5:50 p.m. EST (2250 GMT). It's this webcast that Space.com will simulcast on our VideoFromSpace YouTube channel and on this page.\n\nNASASpaceflight.com is offering its own livestream YouTube. The channel also offers 24/7 live views of SpaceX's Starship preparations and Starbase operations.\n\nIf you live near SpaceX's Starbase or plan to travel to see the launch, you can find areas for in-person launch viewing.\n\nThe public beach along South Padre Island, near the Cameron County Amphitheater and Isla Blanca Park, is a great place to watch the launch with other spectators. Other viewing areas can be found along the shore of nearby Port Isabel, though do plan ahead as traffic can be heavy close to launch time.\n\n\n\nSpaceX's Flight 8 Starship test flight is expected to attempt to replicate the planned Flight 7 mission and should last just over 66 minutes from launch to splashdown.\n\n\"The upcoming flight will fly the same suborbital trajectory as previous missions and will target objectives not reached on the previous test, including Starship’s first payload deployment and multiple reentry experiments geared towards returning the upper stage to the launch site for catch,\" SpaceX wrote in a mission overview. \"The flight also includes the launch, return, and catch of the Super Heavy booster.\"\n\nIf all goes well, the Super Heavy booster will return to the Starbase launch pad to be captured by SpaceX's Mechazilla arms about 7 minutes after liftoff. SpaceX could wave off that catch attempt if anything looks off, directing the Super Heavy to a controlled splashdown offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. (President Trump has signed an executive order renaming the body of water the Gulf of America.)\n\nThe Ship vehicle, meanwhile, will continue flying for the next hour. It is expected to perform a payload deployment test about 17 minutes into the flight, followed by a Raptor engine relight demonstration before reentering Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe Flight 8 Ship is scheduled to make a controlled \"landing\" in the Indian Ocean at the 1-hour, 6-minute mark, then splash into the ocean. If SpaceX replicates previous flights, that drop zone would be somewhere west of Australia.\n\nTIME (Hr:Min:Sec)\n\nEVENT\n\nT-1:15:00\n\nFlight director poll for fuel loading\n\nT-0:45:59\n\nStarship liquid oxygen loading begins\n\nT-0:42:59\n\nStarship liquid methane loading begins\n\nT-0:41:22\n\nSuper Heavy liquid methane loading begins\n\nT-0:35:35\n\nSuper Heavy liquid oxygen loading begins\n\nT-00:19:40\n\nSuper Heavy Raptor engine chilldown\n\nT-00:3:20\n\nStarship fueling complete\n\nT-00:2:50\n\nSuper Heavy fueling complete\n\nT-00:0:30\n\nFlight Director GO for launch\n\nT-00:00:10\n\nFlame deflector activation\n\nT-00:00:03\n\nRaptor ignition sequence startup\n\nT-00:00:00\n\nLiftoff (\"Excitement Guaranteed,\" SpaceX says)\n\nTIME (Hr:Min:Sec)\n\nFLIGHT EVENT\n\nT+00:02\n\nLiftoff\n\nT+01:02\n\nStarship/Super Heavy reach Max Q\n\nT+02:32\n\nSuper Heavy main engine cutoff\n\nT+02:40\n\nHot-staging separation/Starship Raptor engine ignition\n\nT+02:45\n\nSuper Heavy boostback burn startup\n\nT+03:30\n\nSuper Heavy boostback burn engine shutdown\n\nT+03:32\n\nHot-stage jettison\n\nT+06:37\n\nSuper Heavy landing burn startup\n\nT+06:57\n\nSuper Heavy landing burn shutdown and catch try\n\nT+08:44\n\nStarship engine cutoff\n\nT+00:17:24\n\nPayload deploy demo\n\nT+00:37:28\n\nStarship engine relight demonstration\n\nT+00:47:22\n\nStarship reentry\n\nT+01:03:05\n\nStarship transonic\n\nT+1:04:20\n\nStarship is subsonic\n\nT+1:06:04\n\nLanding flip\n\nT+1:06:06\n\nLanding burn\n\nT+1:06:26\n\n\"An exciting landing!\" SpaceX says.\n\n\n\n— Explosion of Starship Flight 7 traced to fires in rocket's 'attic,' SpaceX says\n\n— Starship and Super Heavy: SpaceX's Mars transportation system\n\n— China planning to build its own version of SpaceX's Starship\n\nSince SpaceX wasn't able to launch Starship Flight 8 on March 3, the company has trned to its backup days to try again.\n\nAccording to a public advisory from Cameron County officials overseeing the region of South Texas that includes SpaceX's Starbase, road and beach closure alerts for Boca Chica Beach were in place for March 3, with \"alternative days\" on March 4 and March 5.

    "date": "6 March 2025",
    "content": "SpaceX's Starship megarocket is the world's biggest and most powerful rocket, and the giant booster that will launch the moon lander for NASA's Artemis 3 mission that aims to land astronauts on the moon by 2027.\n\nThe next Starship launch by SpaceX will be Starship Flight 8 on Friday, Feb. 28. at 6:30 p.m. EST (2330 GMT). It will be the second flight of a new version of the Ship and test new enhancements to the Super Heavy Booster while flying a similar profile to that of Flight 5 on Oct. 13, which saw the successful first landing and capture of the Super Heavy booster. It is also expected to include a relight of the Ship engines, test reentry gear for Ship in space and mark the first deployment of simulated Starlink satellites.\n\nRead the latest news about SpaceX's Starship megarocket test flights, launches, photos and more.\n\nStarship Flight 7 debris fall | Flight 5 capture | Starship & Super Heavy | SpaceX\n\n\n\nSpaceX confirms the Starship Ship upper stage for Flight 8 has been lost after losing engines and attide control about 20 seconds before completing its ascent burn. An investigation will soon begin into the failure, which appears reminiscent of a similar failure that doomed SpaceX's Flight 7 Ship vehicle in January.\n\n\"Obviously a lot to go through, a lot to dig through and we're going to go right at it,\" SpaceX's Dan Huot said during live launch commentary. \"We have some more to learn about this vehicle.\" Our wrap story will be posted shortly.\n\n\n\nSpaceX successfully returned its Super Heavy booster to Earth with what appeared to be a flawless catch at its Mechazilla launch pad, but the company reports its Ship upper stage is out of control.\n\nSeveral of the Ship's six Raptor engines appeared to fail during ascent, sending the rocket into a spin with SpaceX ultimately losing contact with the ship as it fell from space.\n\nSpaceX's Starship Super Heavy booster has separated from its Ship upper stage and is returning to Earth. SpaceX is currently GO for a Booster capture attempt, despite seeing 2 Raptor engines out during launch. Ship is continuing its ascent. The Booster is returning to Earth after performing a boost back burn.\n\nSpaceX's Starship Flight 8 test flight lifts off! The giant rocket, the largest ever built, roared off SpaceX's pad at Starbase in South Texas on time at 6:30 p.m. EST (2330 GMT) atop its Super Heavy booster, poweredby 33 Raptor 2 engines. The towering rocket's next milestone will be hot-staging and stage separation, when SpaceX hopes to attempt a Booster catch and landing back at its Mechazilla launch pad.\n\nRange and weather are both very green for launch, SpaceX's Kate Tice says of today's Starship Flight 8 with just minutes to go until launch.\n\n\"Super-green, if you will,\" Tice says.\n\nSpaceX is now less than 8 minutes from the launch of its Starship Flight 8 and counting and all systems are GO for launch.\n\nUnlike SpaceX's Monday launch try, the weather is pristine, with clear visibility for miles, a stark contrast from the clouds seen Monday. No range or technical issues have arisen, again a departure as Monday's launch attempt saw booster and Ship issues.\n\n\n\nAs fueling continues on SpaceX's Starship rocket, the company's Chris Gebhardt just outlined plans for the new Raptor 3 engine SpaceX has designed for future missions.\n\nSpaceX's current Starship Super Heavy uses 33 Raptor 2 engines, with six on the upper stage. The new Raptor 3 is a sleeker design that should help SpaceX shave 1 metric ton of mass off each engine, allowing more capability for future Starship flights.\n\nSpaceX has fueling the Starship Super Heavy booster and Ship upper stage with the super-cold liquid methane and liquid oxygen for today's planned launch of the Flight 8 test flight.\n\n\"The primary paylod for these flights is data,\" SpaceX's Dan Huot said as the company' livestream begins. Huot says weather is \"GO\" and there are no technical issues with Super Heavy or Ship for today's Starship launch.\n\nSpaceX's livestream for today's Starship Flight 8 launch has begun (although it is just playing music for now).\n\nYou can watch the livestream in the window at the top of this page, but it is also available on SpaceX's X page, as well as SpaceX's Starship Flight 8 mission page.\n\n\n\nThe weather is looking good for SpaceX's planned Starship Flight 8 test launch tonight.\n\nIn a status update on social media, SpaceX said it is on track to attempt its planned Starship Flight 8 launch tonight from its Starbase facility near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas.\n\n\"Counting down to Starship's eighth flight test. Weather looks favorable at the pad and the 60-minute launch window opens at 5:30 p.m. CT,\" the company wrote in a post today. That 1 hour launch window means the mission could launch anytime between 6:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. EST (2330-0030 GMT).\n\n\n\nSpaceX is once again poised to launch its Starship Flight 8 test flight today, March 6, with liftoff set for no earlier than 6:30 p.m. EST (2330 GMT).\n\nToday's launch window is the first of three potential \"alternative dates\" through March 8 for the mission after a delayed launch attempt on Monday, March 3.\n\nYou can watch the Starship Flight 8 launch live on Space.com, courtesy of SpaceX, starting at about 5:50 p.m. EST (2250 GMT).\n\nSpaceX announced early today, March 5, that its planned Starship Flight 8 launch will now take place no earlier than Thursday, March 6. Liftoff is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. EST (2330 GMT) that same day.\n\nThe new launch date is a 24-hour delay from what was already a delayed launch for Starship Flight 8. SpaceX scrubbed an attempted launch on Monday, March 3, due to last-minute issues on the megarocket's Booster and Ship stages.\n\n\n\nSpaceX is now targeting no earlier than Wednesday, March 5, for the launch of its Starship Flight 8 test flight. The earliest launch time is the same as before: 6:30 p.m. EST (2330 GMT).\n\nSpaceX attempted to launch Starship and its Super Heavy booster on Monday, March 3, but encountered issues on both Starship's Booster and Ship stages in the final minutes before liftoff. The company opted to stand down for the day in order to better understand the issues.\n\nThat is apparently complete, with the company now confident it can attempt again to fly on Wednesday. As with Monday, SpaceX is expected to have a 30-minute window in which to launch the mission.\n\nStarship Flight 8 is the eighth test flight of SpaceX's Starship launch system. It will test a new version of the Ship vehicle, including a Starlink satellite deployment demonstration and other system tests and upgrades. The Super Heavy booster is expected to return to Earth and be captured by the metal \"chopstick\" arms of its Mechazilla launch pad structure.\n\n\n\nSpaceX has scrubbed today's launch attempt for the eighth test flight of its Starship megarocket. The countdown entered a hold at 40 seconds, which was momentarily lifted after some troubleshooting from SpaceX technicians. Seconds later, however, the rocket's onboard systems triggered an automatic scrub, canceling the launch for today. Another launch attempt will be possible tomorrow, March 3.\n\nRead our wrap story on the Starship Flight 8 scrub and see video.\n\n\n\nThere is a hold on the count at T-minus 40 seconds for the eighth launch of SpaceX's Starship launch vehicle. According to SpaceX officials, technicians are troubleshooting an issue on the booster. Starship has the ability to hold following propellant loading, and SpaceX officials on the company's launch stream expect the count to continue toward launch shortly.\n\n\n\nT-10 minutes! SpaceX is poised to launch the eighth test flight of its Starship megarocket. Launch timeline as follows:\n\n\n\nMission controllers in SpaceX's Starship control room have polled 'go' to proceed with loading propellant for Starship's eighth integrated flight test (IFT-8). An official launch time of 6:45 p.m. ET (2345 GMT, 5:45 p.m. CT local time at Starbase) is being targeted for liftoff.\n\nWatch the launch here and on Space.com, courtesy of SpaceX. A stream is also available on the SpaceX's IFT-8 mission website and their channel on X beginning at 5:59 p.m. ET (2259 GMT).\n\n\n\nSpaceX is as little as one hour away from the eighth launch of the company's Starship megarocket. Propellant line-cooling from the launchpad's cryogenic fuel tanks to the rocket has begun, with propellant loading expected to begin shortly. A 60-minute launch window for the mission opens at 6:30 p.m. ET (2330 GMT, 5:30 p.m. CT local time at Starbase). This is the eighth integrated flight test (IFT-8) for SpaceX's Super Heavy Starship stack.\n\nIFT-8 will include the attempted recover of the first-stage Super Heavy booster back at the Starbase's Pad-A, using the tower's \"chopstick\" arms. Starship's upper stage, Ship 34, will deploy four mass-simulation Starlink broadband satellites while on a suborbital trajectory, before a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean off Western Australia about 66 minutes after launch.\n\nYou can watch it live here and on the Space.com homepage, courtesy of SpaceX, or directly on the company's website and on X. The stream will begin at 5:59 p.m. ET (2259 GMT).\n\n\n\nToday may be the day for SpaceX's Flight 8 Starship launch, as it's the first day of its window of flight opportunities.\n\nOn Sunday, March 2, SpaceX moved the Starship Ship vehicle for the launch to its pad at the company's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. The massive Super Heavy booster was raised atop its Mechazilla launch pad late last week.\n\nIf SpaceX does proceed with a launch today, Starship Flight 8 could lift off as early as 6:30 p.m. EST (2330 GMT), with a livestream beginning at about 5:50 p.m. EST (2250 GMT). You can watch it live here and find out the timing of the misson in our What time is SpaceX's Starship Flight 8 overview.\n\n\n\nSpaceX says it is now targeting no earlier than Monday, March 3, for the launch of its next Starship test mission Flight 8.\n\nThe company announced the delay on the social media site X early Thursday, but did not give a reason for the delay.\n\n\"Now targeting to launch Starship's eighth flight test as soon as Monday, March 3,\" SpaceX said in the X post.\n\nStarship Flight 8 will test new upgrades to SpaceX's Ship vehicle and Super Heavy booster developed in the wake of the company's Flight 6 mission. The upgrades were originally added on SpaceX's Flight 7 launch, but the Ship vehicle suffered a propellant leak and internal fires, leading to its destruction before the test was completed.\n\nThe Starship Flight 8 mission will attempt to test those pgrades, which includes the planned deployment of simulated satellites among other trials.\n\n\n\nSpaceX has rolled out the Super Heavy booster for its Starship Flight 8 launch.\n\nOn Tuesday (Feb. 26), the company annouced its Flight 8 Booster was on the pad at the company's Starbase test site near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas ahead of a planned launch on Friday (Feb. 28). The Ship vehicle is expected to be stacked atop the booster soon ahead of the flight.\n\nSpaceX has test-fired the engines on both the Super Heavy and its Ship vehicle to set the stage for a Flight 8 Starship launch on Friday.\n\n\n\nSpaceX is targeting Friday, Feb. 28, to launch its next Starship megarocket test flight. Liftoff will be at 6:30 pm ET (2330 GMT).\n\nThe Starship Flight 8 mission will launch a stacked Super Heavy booster and Ship vehicle on a trajectory similar to that of SpaceX's Flight 7 test flight last month. That Flight 7 test successfully returned its Super Heavy Booster to Earth with a \"chopsticks\" catch at its launch pad near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas, but the Ship vehicle was lost due to a propellant leak that sparked fires in an \"attic\" space above the engines on the rocket.\n\nDuring Flight 8, SpaceX will attempt to complete many of the objectives of the Flight 7 mission, including the deployment of simulated Starlink satellites, hardware tests for Ship reentry and landing, as well as new flap designs and other upgrades.\n\n\n\nSpaceX is already analyzing data from Starship's explosive seventh flight test.\n\nWhen it launched on Flight Test 7 on Jan. 16, 2024, Starship was able to successfully separate from its Super Heavy booster, which then landed on the company's launch tower at its Starbase facility in South Texas.\n\nHowever, SpaceX lost contact with Starship around eight minutes into the flight. The 'Ship' upper stage then exploded over the Atlantic Ocean. Posting on X, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk says the explosion was likely due to a propellant leak. \"Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity,\" Musk said via X, adding that SpaceX is still aiming for another test flight next month.Read more: SpaceX Starship explosion likely caused by propellant leak, Elon Musk says\n\nStarship apparently didn't make it today.\n\nSpaceX was able to launch Starship and its Super Heavy booster today, and catch the booster successfully as it did on its fifth flight test.\n\nBut Starship, the vehicle's upper stage, was lost just 8.5 minutes into the flight. It's unclear what happened, but SpaceX will be analyzing data in the days to come.\n\n\n\nSpaceX's Starship launched on its seventh flight test today.\n\nThe massive stainless steel rocket lifted off at 5:37 p.m. ET (2237 GMT) from SpaceX's Starbase facility in South Texas.\n\nAfter successfully separating, Starship continued on to orbit, while its Super Heavy booster successfully landed on its launch tower, the second time SpaceX has caught a rocket.\n\nHowever, SpaceX has currently lost contact with Starship. Watch Flight Test 7 live here courtesy of SpaceX for more updates.\n\nSpaceX is ready to launch Starship on its seventh flight test.\n\nThe company has finished loading propellant on both Starship and its Super Heavy booster, and weather, range and vehicle are still 'go' for launch.\n\nYou can watch Flight Test 7 live here courtesy of SpaceX.\n\nSpaceX's livestream for Starship Flight 7 has begun.\n\nWith strong winds blowing at its Starbase facility in South Texas, SpaceX is aiming to launch its Starship megarocket on its seventh flight test. Today's 60-minute window opened at 5 p.m. ET (2200 GMT or 4 p.m. local time), and SpaceX is currently aiming for a liftoff at 5:37 p.m. (2237 GMT or 4:37 p.m. local time).\n\nYou can watch Flight Test 7 live here courtesy of SpaceX.\n\nSpaceX has pushed its launch time back for today's Starship launch.\n\nIn a post on X, the company says it's now aiming for 5:37 p.m. ET (2237 GMT or 4:37 p.m. local time) for Starship Flight Test 7 from Starbase in South Texas.\n\nYou can watch Flight Test 7 live here courtesy of SpaceX. The company's livestream should begin 30 minutes before the launch window opens, at 5:07 p.m. ET (2207 GMT).\n\n\n\nSpaceX says things are looking up for launching Starship today.\n\n\"All systems and weather are looking good,\" the company wrote on X on Thursday (Jan. 16) along with a few photos of the rocket. SpaceX is still aiming to launch Starship during a 60-minute launch window that opens at 5 p.m. ET (2200 GMT or 4 p.m. local Texas time) on Thursday, Jan. 16.\n\nWatch Flight Test 7 live here courtesy of SpaceX. The company's livestream should begin about 30 minutes before the launch window opens, at 4:30 p.m. ET (2130 GMT).\n\n\n\nSpaceX could launch Starship on its seventh flight test today.\n\nSpaceX is looking at a 60-minute flight window that opens at 5 p.m. ET (2200 GMT or 4 p.m. local time) to launch Starship from the company's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Beach, Texas.\n\nOn this flight, Starship will deploy payloads for the first time when it releases ten Starlink satellite simulators that are the same size as the company's upcoming next-generation spacecraft.\n\nThe Starship upper stage on today's flight has also undergone several developmental hardware changes to its forward fins and propulsion system.\n\nWatch it live here courtesy of SpaceX. The company's livestream should begin about 30 minutes before the launch window opens at 4:30 p.m. ET (2130 GMT).\n\n\n\nStarship won't fly today, after all.\n\nIn a post on X, SpaceX announced that Starship Flight 7 has been delayed until no earlier than Thursday (Jan. 16) due to weather concerns.\n\nThe 60-minute window will open at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT). You can watch the action live here at Space.com courtesy of SpaceX, or directly via the company. Coverage will begin about 35 minutes before launch.\n\n\n\nIt's another big day in spaceflight today as SpaceX readies to launch Starship Flight 7.\n\nSpaceX's massive Starship rocket and Super Heavy booster will attempt to launch during a 60-minute window that opens at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT or 4 p.m. local time) on Wednesday, Jan. 15.\n\nToday's flight will feature a multitude of hardware changes SpaceX has made on the Starship upper stage based on data from the previous two flights, including moving the Starship's forward fins to make them more resistant to reentry heating, and making improvements to the vehicle's propulsion system.\n\nStarship will deploy 10 Starlink satellite simulators on today's flight while in orbit, which are similar in size and weight to the company's upcoming next-generation Starlink spacecraft. This will be the first time SpaceX has attempted to deploy payloads from Starship.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, SpaceX will once again attempt to catch Starship's Super Heavy booster for landing with the \"chopsticks\" on its launch tower, a feat the company accomplished on Flight 5 in October 2024.\n\nYou can watch the Starship Flight 7 launch live on Space.com today courtesy of SpaceX. The company's livestream should begin about 35 minutes before the launch window opens, around 4:25 p.m. EST (2130 GMT).\n\nStay tuned for more updates as launch time approaches.\n\n\n\nSpaceX has postponed the launch of tis Starship Fligth 7 test flight to no earlier than Wednesday, Jan. 15, a two-day slip. Liftoff is still set for 5 p.m. EST (4 p.m. CT/2200 GMT) on launch day.\n\nSpaceX announced the launch date change late Saturday night, without details on the cause of the delay.\n\n\"Now targeting Wednesday, January 15 for the seventh flight test of Starship,\" SpaceX wrote on X.\n\nJan. 15 is currently the last \"alternative day\" SpaceX has listed for road closures around its Starbase facility for the launch by Cameron County officials, but the company could potentially set additional backup days in the days ahead.\n\nA Notice To Airmen alert from the FAA related to Starship Flight 7 runs from Jan. 9 to Han. 17, suggesting the company could have at least two more days in its line up for a Flight 7 launch.\n\nNow targeting Wednesday, January 15 for the seventh flight test of Starship → https://t.co/QNCSPTdYW2 pic.twitter.com/xz8eNkfV0TJanuary 12, 2025\n\n\n\nSpaceX has conducted a successful fueling and launch rehearsal for its upcoming Starship Flight 7 test flight, which is scheduled to lift off on Monday, Jan. 13, at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT). Here's our handy guide on what time SpaceX will launch Starship Flight 7.\n\nLate Friday (Jan. 10), the company reported on the launch rehearsal, which occurred the same day the company reported it had fully assembled the nearly 400-foot (122 meters) rocket for flight.\n\n\"Starship and Super Heavy loaded with nearly 11 million pounds of propellant in a launch rehearsal ahead of the seventh flight test,\" SpaceX wrote on X on Friday.\n\nStarship and Super Heavy loaded with nearly 11 million pounds of propellant in a launch rehearsal ahead of the seventh flight test pic.twitter.com/aSWDcEGAznJanuary 11, 2025\n\n\n\nSpaceX has moved the Starship Ship vehicle it will use for its Starship Flight 7 out to its pad at the company's Starbase test site near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. The Ship vehicle will be attached to its Super Heavy booster for a planned launch on Monday, Jan. 13, at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT).\n\nYou'll be able to watch SpaceX's Starship Flight 7 launch live online via SpaceX's Flight 7 mission page and X account. We'll also have it live on Space.com at launch time.\n\nStarship Flight 7 is SpaceX's first Starship launch of 2025 and the first flight of a new, upgraded version of the Starship spacecraft. The new design includes flaps that have been moved forward and reduced in size. It has 25% more propellant volume and upgrades to engine feed lines. The spacecraft also has a new generation of heat tiles, upgraded avionics - including a more powerful flight computer - and other enhancements designed to allow Starship to stay in space for longer periods.\n\n\n\nSpaceX's next Starship test flight is a step closer to launch.\n\nThis week, SpaceX and the FAA announced a series of milestones that put billionaire Elon Musk's company on track for a new Starship launch. That mission, called Flight 7, will mark the seventh test flight of a Starship Ship vehicle and SUper Heavy booster.\n\nThe FAA launch license for Flight 7 clears an essential hurdle for SpaceX's Starship Flight 7 test flight, while also including some leeway in the case of specific failure scenarios (such as a vehicle lost at sea) that do not include damage to ground-based structures or injuries.\n\nIn the last week, SpaceX has also test-fired the Starship Flight 7 Ship, as well as its Super Heavy booster. The company also tested the Ship's ability to relight its Raptor engines in space.\n\nThe Flight 7 Ship will be a new version of Starship designed to improve the overall performance of the spacecraft, SpaceX has said. The new design includes forward flaps that are both smaller and in a slightly different location to better protect them during reentry, company officials have said. It will also include more redundancy for reliability, and systems to operate longer in space.\n\nWhile SpaceX has not yet released a specific flight plan for Starship Flight 7, the FAA launch license for the mission includes a similar profile to Flight 5 and Flight 6. Those launches included plans to launch the Ship vehicle on a path that ended with a \"soft-landing\" in the Indian Ocean, while the Super Heavy booster aimed to return to the launch site to be caught in the giant metal \"chopsticks\" of its launch tower.\n\nSpaceX's Starship Flight 5 test in October successfully caught the Super Heavy booster in the \"chopsticks,\" but the company ultimately waived off a capture attempt on the Flight 6 mission, and performed a soft-landing in the Gulf of Mexico instead.\n\nSome media reports have suggested SpaceX could attempt a Starship Flight 7 launch in early January, perhaps around Jan. 11, but SpaceX has not yet issued a targeted launch date.\n\n\n\nSpaceX's Starship Flight 6 Ship vehicle made what appeared to be a smooth descent and splashdown in the Indian Ocean. Read our full recap of the Starship Flight 6 launch and landing with photos and video.\n\nThe vehicle made a flawless landing burn, pitch over and soft-landing as cameras on a buoy looked on.\n\nUnlike SpaceX's Flight 5 test flight, the Ship did not appear to explode after splashdown, but merely tipped over on its side engulfed in flames. SpaceX warned the public not to approach any Starship debris in the ocean from Ship or the Super Heavy booster as a safety measure.\n\nThis will wrap up our SpaceX Starship Flight 6 live updates. Thanks for joining us and we'll see you with SpaceX's Flight 7 test, which could occur soon.\n\nSpaceX's Starship Flight 6 vehicle is reentering the Earth's atmosphere and going through its peak heating phase as it returns to Earth.\n\nSpaceX is intentionally putting the vehicle through a harsher reentry profile and removed more than 20,000 heat tiles to test the heating environment and stress on the spacecraft.\n\n\n\nSpaceX's Starship Flight 6 vehicle has fired up one of its six main engines in an in-space relight test that appears to have gone well. The test was very brief, but was a critical demonstration for future in-space maneuvers by Starship vehicles.\n\nThe Ship vehicle is on a reentry approach, with an orange plasma glow as it proceeds back to Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaceX's Starship Flight 6 Ship vehicle is currently in a 40-minute cruise mode as it flies around Earth following a successful launch from the company's Starbase facility.SpaceX will attempt a Raptor engine relight during this cruise phase as a test for future flights. The vehicle will then make a descent and soft splashdown in the Indian Ocean after undergoing a reentry heating and flight profile that will be more rigorous that SpaceX's Flight 5 test flight last month.\n\n\n\nSPLASHDOWN! SpaceX's Starship Flight 6 Super Heavy booster has splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico after SpaceX waived off its rocket catch attempt during landing.\n\nThe company did not give a specific reason for aborting the launch pad catch of the rocket, but did say that many factors had to go right to proceed with the attempt. \"We tripped a commit criteria,\" SpaceX's Dan Huot said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Starship vehicle itself has reached its nominal altitude and is in a cruise phase for today's hourlong flight.\n\nSpaceX is NO GO for a Super Heavy booster catch, and is waiving off to an offshore soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy booster have successfully separated, with SpaceX GO for a booster catch at its launch pad.\n\nLIFTOFF! SpaceX's Starship Flight 6 has lifted off from SpaceX's Starbase pad near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas in an on time launch at 5 pm ET.\n\nThe Starship and its Super Heavy booster ignited 33 Raptor engines on its first stage to begin the climb to space.\n\nThis is SpaceX's 6th Starship test flight. If all goes well, the Super Heavy may return to its launch site for a mechanical arm capture and landing, with the Starship headed on an hourlong trip to landing and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\nSpaceX's Starship Flight 6 spacecraft and Suepr Heavy booster are just minutes away from launch as fueling concludes. Weather looks very good for flight, with no technical issues.\n\n\"The fun part is about to start,\" SpaceX's Dan Huot saidLiftoff is MINUTES AWAY from launch at 5 pm ET.\n\n\n\nSpaceX has revealed its first payload to fly on a Starship rocket: a stuffed banana.\n\nThe company is launching a plush banana suspended by wires inside the giant Starship vehicle and is promising live views of the banana throughout the flight if all goes well.\n\nSpaceX placed an emblem of a pixelated banana holding a banana on the nose of the Starship vehicle to mark this flight. The company is also selling the banana plush toy for $30 on its website, as well as the banana emblem as wall decal for $75.Meanwhile, on Starship: \"Starship and Super Heavy’s 39 Raptor engines are chilling down in preparation for liftoff,\" the company says.\n\n\n\nFueling is in fuel swing for SpaceX's Starship Flight 6 test flight. \"We're loading right up to the last possible minute,\" SpaceX spokesman Dan Huot said in a live commentary. \"Weather is fantastic, light breeze, no clouds in the sky, not tracking any hardware constraints to launch today, if we're not able to get off the path, though, we've got opportunities throughout the week.\"\n\nSpaceX says its Starship Flight 6 spacecraft and Super Heavy booster are \"go\" for fueling.\n\n\"The Starship team is go for prop load,\" SpaceX wrote in an update. The company is expected to start its live launch webcast soon.\n\nStarship is fueled by 10 million pounds of super-cold liquid methane and liquid oxygen propellant to feed its 33 Raptor engines on the Super Heavy and six vacuum Raptor engines on the Starship upper stage.\n\n\n\nSpaceX is just hours away from its Starship Flight 6 launch and the company will have a special guest on scene to watch the launch.\n\n\"I’m heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space, but simply by lifting off the ground,\" Trump wrote on X (formerly Twitter). \"Good luck to @ElonMusk and the Great Patriots involved in this incredible project!\"\n\nTrump repeatedly referred to SpaceX's successful Starship Flight 5 launch, which included the first catch of a Super Heavy booster, during the final days of his presidential campaign as well as during his victory speech after winning the U.S. election.\n\nI’m heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space, but simply by lifting off the ground. Good luck to @ElonMusk and the Great Patriots involved in this incredible project! https://t.co/UVpVSkpEyuNovember 19, 2024\n\n\n\nIt is launch day for SpaceX's Starship Flight 6 and the company appears on track for today's planned rocket launch and Super Heavy booster catch from Starbase near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. Liftoff is targeted for 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT), with a livestream to begin at 4:30 p.m. EST (2130 GMT).\n\n\"All systems and weather are looking good for today's flight test of Starship,\" SpaceX wrote in an update on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nYou'll be able to watch the SpaceX Starship Flight 6 launch webcast live on Space.com at start time.\n\nAll systems and weather are looking good for today's flight test of Starship.The live launch webcast on @X will go live ~40 minutes before liftoff, which is targeted for 4:00 p.m. CT → https://t.co/1xyLhQKE2N pic.twitter.com/lqy2CsL4vzNovember 19, 2024\n\n\n\nSpaceX has fueled the its massive Starship rocket and Super Heavy booster in a test for the company's Flight 6 test flight ahead of a planned launch on Tuesday, Nov. 19.\n\nThe towering Starship and Super Heavy passed a so-called \"wet-dress rehearsal\" on Sunday, Nov. 17, as SpaceX prepares for the Flight 6 launch. The fueling test was one of the final checks ahead of the test flight, which will mark SpaceX's sixth Starship launch overall.\n\nLike SpaceX's Flight 5 launch on Oct. 13, Flight 6 aims to launch a Starship rocket atop a Super Heavy booster, return the booster to Earth to be captured by metal \"chopsticks\" at the launch pad, and then soft-land the Starship in the Indian Ocean.\n\nWhile the flight profile of Flight 6 is similar to that of Flight 5, there are key differences. Check out our What to Expect for Starship Flight 6 overview for more.\n\nSpaceX is currently targeting Tuesday, Nov. 19, at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT) to launch Starship Flight 6, with a livestream beginning at 4:30 p.m. EST (2130 GMT). You'll be able to watch the Starship Flight 6 live online, including on Space.com, at that time.\n\n\n\nSpaceX is now targeting Tuesday, Nov. 19, to launch its sixth Starship test flight from the company's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas.\n\nThe Starship and Super Heavy booster were stacked for flight on Friday, Nov. 15, in advance of the launch. SpaceX was initially targeting a launch date of no earlier than Nov. 18, with potential backup dates on Nov. 19 and Nov. 20.\n\nThe company is now targeting no earlier than Nov. 19 at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT) for the launch, with at least one backup day on Nov. 20, based on road closure alerts from the Texas's Cameron County officials.\n\n\n\nSpaceX is now targeting Nov. 18 for its next Starship launch, which will loft the sixth test flight of the world's largest rocket.\n\nFlight 6 of SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy booster is scheduled to lift off no earlier than Monday, Nov. 18, from the company's Starbase test site near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. Liftoff is set for 4 p.m. EST (2100 GMT) during a 30-minute launch window.\n\nAs with SpaceX's successful Flight 5 on Oct. 13, Flight 6 will attempt to capture the Starship Super Heavy booster at its landing site using giant metal \"chopsticks.\" The Ship vehicle, meanwhile, will attempt a \"soft landing\" in the Indian Ocean before splashing down and sinking.\n\nSpaceX's Starship Flight 5 vehicle successfully made a \"soft-landing\" in the Indian Ocean, showing live all the way down. After its landing burn, the Starship vehicle tipped over on its side to fall into the ocean, then appeared to explode to end its mission. Read our full wrap story and see photos and video.\n\n\"I think it's safe to say, we have a Ship in the water,\" SpaceX's Kate Tice said.\n\nSpaceX showed live video of the splashdown aftermath from a buoy that was waiting at the splashdown site.\n\nAnd that is a wrap for today's SpaceX Flight 5 Starship launch. At the time of its ending, about 4 million people were watching SpaceX's livestream. We will update our wrap story with the successful splashdown shortly and thanks for joining us!\n\nThe Starship Flight 5 vehicle is subsonic and nearing its landing flip for an attempted soft-landing in the Indian Ocean.\n\n\n\nSpaceX's Starship Flight 5 vehicle has passed through the peak heating phase of today's reentry and appears to be on track for its upcoming landing flip and burn.\n\nThere does appear to be some burn through on one of the four flaps on the spacecraft in live views.\n\n\n\nSpaceX's Starship vehicle has begun its reentry into Earth's atmosphere, with a red glow of super hot plasma visible in live views from the spacecraft delivered by SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet constellation.\n\nIt should take about 10 minutes for Starship to complete reentry.\n\nSpaceX's Starship vehicle is in a 1-hour coast phase as it makes its away to the other side of the world for a reentry over the Indian Ocean, west of Australia.\n\nA jubilant SpaceX is still reeling from the successful capture of its Super Heavy rocket on the first try. Drone video is showing spectacular views of the towering booster hanging from its Mechazilla launch pad arms after the capture.\n\nSpace.com's initial launch story will be posted shortly.\n\nSpaceX just made history with the successful capture of its Super Heavy rocket during an audacious first landing attempt of the most powerful rocket on Earth.\n\nSpaceX's Starship Super Heavy rocket is headed back to its launch site for today's historic landing attempt. SpaceX has live views of the booster on its way back to Earth.\n\n\"We are go for catch,\" Kate Tice says,\n\nThe Starship Flight 5 Super Heavy booster has separated from its Starship vehicle and successfully completed its boostback burn.\n\nSpaceX's launch tower is GO for catch attempt for landing!\n\nStarship continues its ascent.\n\nLIftoff! SpaceX's fifth Starship and Super Heavy test flight has cleared the pad at 8:25 a.m. EDT (1225 GMT). The launch is proceeding.\n\n\n\nAt the T-5 minute mark, SpaceX continues to work to clear boats from the offshore launch range.\n\nSpokesman Dan Hout says SpaceX may hold the launch for up to 5 minutes, the rest of its window, in order to get those ships clear. Aside from that, no issues for launch.\n\nSpaceX is now 10 minutes away and counting to the launch of its Starship Flight 5 mission. There are about 1 million people watching the company's livestream on X and nearly 20K on Space.com's VideoFromSpace stream.\n\nSpaceX reports that the 39 engines on the Starship/Super Heavy rocket (33 on Super Heavy and six on Starship) are in a chilldown phase in preparation for today's launch.\n\nSpaceX spokesperson Dan Hout reports no technical issues for today's launch. SpaceX is working to clear the launch range offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, but expected to be clear at launch time.\n\n\"As of right now, we're just under 14 minutes to liftoff and not working any issues,\" Hout says.\n\n\n\nSpaceX says Starship Flight 5 will use new heat shield tiles the company has designed to be stronger and perform better than those used on the Starship Flight 4 vehicle.\n\nThe company has also made upgrades to the launch tower and catching mechanism for today's flight.\n\nStarship will also carry some special aluminum heat shield tiles to collect more information on the heating environment during reentry on the vehicle.\n\nSpaceX's Starship Flight 5 livestream has begun! You can follow it live on Space.com's homepage, on this page and at our YouTube channel.\n\nSpaceX has now begun fueling the Starship Super Heavy booster for today's launch.\n\nThe company's webcast has not yet begun on X.\n\nToday's launch, originally scheduled for 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT), was pushed back to 8:25 a.m. EDT (1225 GMT). The company's initial 30-minute launch window for today's flight will close at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT), if SpaceX sticks to it.\n\nSpaceX has begun fueling the Starship upper stage with the liquid methane and liquid oxygen propellant to power its six Raptor engines.\n\nFueling of the Super Heavy first stage for its 33 Raptor rocket engines is expected to begin shortly.\n\nSpaceX reports all systems are \"go\" to begin fueling the Starship rocketship and its Super Heavy booster for today's planned Flight 5 test flight but it seems like there's a new 8:25 a.m. ET (1225GMT) launch time from the company's Starbase site near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas.\n\n\"The Starship team is go for prop load, and weather is looking ideal for today's flight test!\" SpaceX wrote in an X update. \"The launch webcast will go live ~35 minutes ahead of liftoff which is currently targeted for 7:25am CT.\"\n\nA launch time at 7:25 a.m. CT (8:25 a.m. EDT) would set a 7:45 a.m. EDT webcast start time 35 minutes earlier.\n\nSpaceX remains go for today's planned Starship Flight 5 launch test and you'll be able to watch it all live on Space.com.\n\nSpaceX's webcast will begin at about 7:35 a.m. EDT (1135 GMT) with a targeted launch time of 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT). SpaceX has a 30-minute launch window for today's test flight, and may have backup opportunities on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThe primary webcast will be livestreamed on SpaceX's X page, but you can also watch it on YouTube at Space.com's VideoFromSpace channel.\n\n\"Currently still go for launch,\" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wrote on X a few hours ago.\n\nI'm Tariq Malik, Editor-in-Chief of Space.com, and will have live commentary here as events warrant for the mission.\n\nToday's flight test should last about 65 minutes, with much of the action occurring up front as SpaceX hopes to attempt the first landing and capture of its Super Heavy booster at its Mechazilla launch pad. That should occur in the first 8 minutes. At the 65-minute mark, the Starship vehicle is expected to reentry over the Indian Ocean, west of Australia, and could include live views from the spacecraft as on Flight 4 in June.\n\n\n\nSpaceX's Flight 5 Starship and Super Heavy rocket are fully stacked and one day away from launch, and CEO Elon Musk says the company is excited to attempt is first-ever booster catch.\n\n\"Looks like Starship might fly on Sunday! This the largest & most powerful flying object ever made at more than double the thrust of the Saturn V Moon rocket,\" Musk wrote on X late Friday. \"We will try to catch it upon return to launch site using the Mechazilla arms like giant chopsticks (like Karate Kid)!\n\nLooks like Starship might fly on Sunday!This the largest & most powerful flying object ever made at more than double the thrust of the Saturn V Moon rocket. We will try to catch it upon return to launch site using the Mechazilla arms like giant chopsticks (like Karate Kid)! https://t.co/8g7mLaTCRKOctober 11, 2024\n\nWhile SpaceX hopes to try and catch the Super Heavy booster, the company may opt to \"soft-land\" it in the Gulf of Mexico if anything looks off for the flight.\n\n\"SpaceX engineers have spent years preparing and months testing for the booster catch attempt, with technicians pouring tens of thousands of hours into building the infrastructure to maximize our chances for success. We accept no compromises when it comes to ensuring the safety of the public and our team, and the return will only be attempted if conditions are right,\" SpaceX wrote in a mission overview.\n\n\"Thousands of distinct vehicle and pad criteria must be met prior to a return and catch attempt of the Super Heavy booster, which will require healthy systems on the booster and tower and a manual command from the mission’s Flight Director,\" SpaceX added. \"If this command is not sent prior to the completion of the boostback burn, or if automated health checks show unacceptable conditions with Super Heavy or the tower, the booster will default to a trajectory that takes it to a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.\"\n\nSpaceX and Cameron County officials have issued a sonic boom warning to the residents living in the general area around the company's Starbase facility so they can expect the loud booms of the Super Heavy's return.\n\n\n\nSpaceX is officially \"GO\" to launch the Starship Flight 5 test flight for its new megarocket after receiving a launch license from the Federal Aviation Administration. The launch is set for Sunday, Oct. 13, at 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT).\n\n\"The FAA has issued a license modification authorizing SpaceX to launch multiple missions of the Starship/Super Heavy vehicle on the Flight 5 mission profile,\" FAA officials wrote in a statement today (Oct. 12). \"The FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental and other licensing requirements for the suborbital test flight.\"\n\nFor this test flight, SpaceX will launch the Starship and Super Heavy booster, which together are the world's largest and most powerful rocket, and attempt to return the booster to its launch pad at the company's Starbase facility and capture it with a the giant arms of its \"Mechazilla\" pad structure. The Starship rocket, meanwhile, will fly on a path that will take it over the Indian Ocean, where SpaceX hopes to perform a smooth reentry and \"soft landing\" in the ocean.\n\n\n\nSpaceX on Friday, Oct. 11, said its next Starship rocket could launch as early as Sunday, Oct. 13, pending final FAA regulatory approvals. Liftoff is targeted for no earlier than 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT) on Oct. 13, if the approvals come through in time. A livestream of the launch will be available on this page at launch time.\n\nThe upcoming test flight, called Starship Flight 5, will liftoff off from SpaceX's Starbase testing site near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas - the same site for four previous Starship launch tests. This flight aims to build on SpaceX's Starship Flight 4 success on June 6, which marked the first Starship to reach space and a smooth \"soft\" splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico for the rocket's massive Super Heavy booster.\n\nFor Flight 5, SpaceX hopes to recreate the success of the Starship vehicle's trajectory to target splashdown site in the Indian Ocean. But in a first, SpaceX will also attempt to return the rocket's massive Super Heavy booster, which is powered by 33 Raptor engines, back to its launch pad. There, SpaceX will attempt to catch the booster in the \"chopsticks\" of its massive Mechazilla launch pad structure. The system is designed to eventually allow quick turnarounds for Starship Super Heavy boosters for flights.\n\n\"Starship stacked ahead of its fifth flight test,\" SpaceX wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday afternoon (Oct. 11). \"We expect regulatory approval in time to fly on October 13.\"\n\nStarship stacked ahead of its fifth flight test. We expect regulatory approval in time to fly on October 13 pic.twitter.com/HCN4dcm1hZOctober 11, 2024\n\nSpaceX and its CEO Elon Musk have said repeatedly that they have been ready to launch Starship Flight 5 since August, but have been held up by FAA reviews and proposed fines related to environmental concerns over the rocket's water deluge system.Last month, the FAA said it would likely take until November to issue a license for the Starship Flight 5 launch due to additional reviews related to the water deluge system, which FAA officials have required consultation with other regulatory agencies. Meanwhile, SpaceX is also facing potential fines from the FAA amounting to $633,000 related to Falcon 9 rocket launches. SpaceX has bristled at both the Flight 5 Starship delays and the potential fines, threatening to sue the FAA on the latter issue.\n\nStarship Die Cast Rocket Model Now $47.99 on Amazon.\n\nIf you can't see SpaceX's Starship in person, you can score a model of your own. Standing at 13.77 inches (35 cm), this is a 1:375 ratio of SpaceX's Starship as a desktop model. The materials here are alloy steel and it weighs just 225g.\n\n\"We find ourselves delayed for unreasonable and exasperating reasons,\" SpaceX wrote in a blog post on Sept. 10. \"Unfortunately, we continue to be stuck in a reality where it takes longer to do the government paperwork to license a rocket launch than it does to design and build the actual hardware. This should never happen and directly threatens America's position as the leader in space.\"\n\nWhen fully assembled, SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy booster stand about 400 feet (122 m) tall, making it the world's tallest and most powerful rocket. Both the Starship and its Super Heavy booster are designed to be reusable, though the Flight 5 mission does not plan to recover the Starship vehicle.\n\nNASA has picked SpaceX's Starship as the lunar lander for its Artemis 3 mission, which aims to send up to four astronauts to the moon for a crewed landing sometime in 2026. SpaceX has also sold at least one flight Starship to American billionaire Jared Isaacman, with reservations for another Starship trip around the moon. One Starship circumlunar flight reserved by Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa was canceled earlier this year.\n\nWe will post updates on Starship Flight 5 and subsequent test flights and missions here as events warrant.\n\nSpaceX launches 21 Starlink satellites to orbit, loses Falcon 9 booster after landing (video)\n\nEurope's powerful Ariane 6 rocket launches for 2nd time ever, sending French spy satellite to orbit (video)\n\nHope is all but lost for private asteroid probe in deep space — 'the chance of talking with Odin is minimal'"

    "date": "19 February 2025",
    "content": "Hunting for alien civilizations isn't a matter of just waiting around for them to show up; it's the business of combing through enormous volumes of data to look for peculiar signals. The good news is that astronomers have developed an efficient method for doing exactly this. The bad news is that they haven't found anything … yet.\n\nIt seems like a somewhat reasonable assumption that if other civilizations are out there in the universe, eventually they will discover how to emit powerful radio broadcasts. Radio waves are capable of traversing great interstellar distances, so they make a great calling card. This is the foundational assumption for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). Strange radio signals might be a sign of an artificial transmission from an alien species.\n\nBut our Milky Way galaxy is swimming in radio emissions of all sorts, from exploding stars to the vibrational hum of the galaxy's magnetic field. Plus, humanity has developed a particular fondness for radio transmissions, so any radio search for aliens must deal with enormous quantities of human-caused signals.\n\nPrevious SETI searches have scanned large areas of the sky and flagged anything interesting that popped up. Then, researchers have combed through the flagged results by hand, searching for signs of artificial transmission while ruling out potential causes of human-made interference.\n\nPrevious SETI searches have also come up totally empty — which isn't a big surprise, since this semimanual technique limits how much data any one research team can process.\n\nEnter COSMIC, the Commensal Open-source Multi-mode Interferometric Cluster. COSMIC is a computer and software system that piggybacks on that of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, the iconic radio array located in the desert of New Mexico.\n\nCOSMIC is designed to automate the process of SETI searches as much as possible. By combining fast processing and a series of restrictive filters, the system searches signal after signal, deciding if it's likely to be artificial and, if it is, determining if it matches the signature of a known terrestrial source.\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!\n\nIn particular, COSMIC searches for radio signals that are very tightly focused, suggesting that they come from a very small source, like a planetary surface. Next, it looks for Doppler shifting of that radio signal. If the signal comes from a planet, the motion of the planet will either redshift or blueshift the signal, depending on whether the planet is moving away from or toward us when the signal was emitted. If the system finds a signal matching these properties, it is flagged and advanced to the next stage of filtering.\n\nRelated: How AI is helping us search the universe for alien technosignatures\n\nNext, the astronomers behind COSMIC know the properties of terrestrial radio emission. This unwanted artificial emission follows particular statistical properties. If the flagged signal of interest matches those properties, the signal is rejected. Any remaining signals are then flagged for further review.\n\n—How the 'Great Filter' could explain why we haven't found intelligent aliens\n\n—Does alien life need a planet to survive? Scientists propose intriguing possibility\n\n—Why haven't we found intelligent alien civilizations? There may be a 'universal limit to technological development'\n\nThe COSMIC system is a part of the VLA Sky Survey, which completed a scan of roughly 82% of the Northern Hemisphere's sky. All told, the COSMIC system analyzed over 950,000 individual pointings of the telescope. Although the system initially flagged thousands of potentially interesting signals, none survived all of the filtering steps.\n\nIn other words, a deep radio search of a good chunk of the Northern Hemisphere found no artificial radio signals.\n\nAlthough this is initially discouraging, this result still represents an important advance in our search for alien life. We can use this data to narrow down the probabilities of life appearing on any one planet, and we now have a valuable tool for collecting and processing data in future surveys, which might turn up something much more interesting.\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

    "date": "1 March 2025",
    "content": "The world's first private spaceraft built to visit an asteroid is slowly tumbling in space and the outlook is dire.\n\nThe spacecraft, called Odin, launched atop a SpaceX rocket on Wednesday (Feb. 26) on a mission to fly by the small asteroid 2022 OB5 for AstroForge, a company that aims to eventually mine the nearby space rock. But just hours after liftoff, Astroforge hit snags with the probe. The last contact was 20 hours after launch.\n\n\"I think we all know the hope is fading as we continue the mission,\" AstroForge founder Matt Gialich said in a video update on X early Saturday (March 1). \"So we're going to keep our head up. We're going to keep trying over the weekend, and we'll see how far we get.\"\n\nAt the time of Gialich's update Saturday morning, the Odin spacecraft was over 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) from Earth and largely following its intended trajectory. On Friday, AstroForge said the spacecraft's solar panels were generating power, with tracking data showing it at its expected position. But the probe has not sent full telemetry on its status.\n\nGialich said AstroForge experienced challenges with ground stations designed to keep communication lines open with Odin after launch.\n\n\"And I think missing our early ground stations really hurt the ability of us to fix any potential problems we had,\" he said.\n\nThe 265-pound (120 kilograms) Odin was only designed to last 2.5 hours on its internal battery, but AstroForge received its last contact from the probe 20 hours after liftoff, boosting confidence that the spacecraft is powered.\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!\n\n\n\nOdin is tumbling ever so slowly as it flies through space, Gialich added, confirming one theory based on observations of the spacecraft.\n\n\"And when I say tumble, this is a really, really low speed tumble,\" Gialich said. \"But in short, we don't know why and that's going to be the problem going forward.\"\n\nAstroForge's mission team is working through the weekend on recovery efforts, but options may be limited.\n\n\"We have a plan over the weekend, and there is still a chance that we are going to be able to recover the vehicle,\" Gialich said. \"We do think we have some theories on what's going on, and if one of them is true, there is still a recovery path.\"\n\n—  SpaceX rocket launches private moon lander and NASA 'trailblazer' to hunt for lunar water (video)\n\n— Space mining company AstroForge identifies asteroid target for Odin launch next month\n\n— Space mining startup AstroForge aims to launch historic asteroid-landing mission in 2025\n\nGialich said AstroForge will share a more detailed update on its website this weekend, followed by an in-depth analysis on the anomaly next week.\n\nGialich founded AstroForge with the goal of mining the vast resources from asteroids for use on Earth and in space. The Odin mission is a scouting effort to fly by asteroid 2022 OB5 to record images and data that would set the stage for a landing by AstroForge's next mission, called Vestri.\n\nThe company built Odin in just 10 months, Gialich said. It launched as a piggyback payload alongside the company Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander, NASA's Lunar Trailblazer moon orbiter (which is also suffering issues after launch) and a small orbital tug demonstrator built by Epic Aerospace.\n\nGialich stressed that AstroForge is committed to that Vestri asteroid landing mission despite the challenges facing its Odin probe.\n\n\"We have probably the best group of investors in the world. A lot of them have doubled down on this company,\" Gialich said. \"So regardless of the outcome of Odin, regardless if we ever talk to it again or we don't, we're going to roll these findings into the next mission.\n\n\"And we'll see you back here in about a year when we take another stab at it.\"\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

    "date": "21 February 2025",
    "content": "This astronaut won't be letting his prosthetic leg ground him to the confines of Earth.\n\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA) reserve astronaut John McFall has just become the first person with a physical disability to be medically certified to launch on a long-duration mission to the International Space Station (ISS). The surgeon and former Paralympian took part in a study to demonstrate the feasibility of the flight, which recently concluded.\n\nMcFall was selected for ESA's Fly! Feasibility study in 2022, which aimed to demonstrate the technical viability of flying someone with a disability in space. Now that the study has concluded, McFall and the UK Space Agency are cheering him on toward his next steps: Fly! Mission Ready.\n\nMcFall lost his leg when he was 19, as a result of a motorcycle accident. Since then, he's never considered himself a \"passive amputee,\" he previously told Space.com. He won a bronze medal in the 100-meter sprint during the 2008 Paralympics, and has earned a master's degree in biomechanics and gait analysis.\n\n\"I'm quite involved in my care. I know how my prosthesis works. I'm a technology demonstrator,\" McFall said.\n\nLiz Johns, Interim Head of Space Exploration at the UK Space Agency, praised McFall for the milestone in a statement, saying, \"it is fantastic to see that John and the team at ESA have proved it is technically possible for someone with a physical disability like his to live and work on the International Space Station. \"\n\nFly! Mission Ready, the next phase of the study, consists of three main components — the types of science that could be conducted during McFall's mission, final qualification of his prosthetics, and a final medical certification. In the statement, McFall hailed the certification as \"a really important milestone in the history of human spaceflight.\"\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!\n\n\"It's great that we can say after a huge amount of work in the last 18 months that we have demonstrated that it’s technically possible for someone with a disability like mine to fly on a long duration mission,\" McFall said.\n\n— Para-astronaut John McFall hopes to see an ISS astronaut with a disability fly by 2030 (exclusive, video)\n\n— Astronaut John McFall explains how the Paralympic Games shaped his space career (exclusive)\n\n— Astronaut John McFall carries Paralympic flag at opening ceremony\n\nMcFall was selected as a reserve astronaut after a call for para-astronaut candidates was issued at the end of Phase 1 of the Fly! study, in 2022. The study was initiated jointly by ESA and NASA, and determined to focus the beginnings of their research on lower limb disabilities.\n\n\"The Mission Ready phase is an important step in moving forward to realize a potential flight opportunity. This phase will include looking at hardware certification and moving further down that process ... should I get the opportunity to fly and importantly we’re looking towards medical certification for me to fly on a long duration mission,\" he added.\n\nMcFall does not yet have a mission assignment or timeline for when a potential launch might take place, but hopes to make it on the manifest before the ISS is decommissioned sometime after 2030.\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

    "title": "What time will the private Blue Ghost probe land on the moon today? How to watch live. [Updated]",
    "date": "2 March 2025",
    "content": "Update for 4:30 am ET: Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander successfully landed on the moon early Sunday, March 2. Read our full story on the historic landing.\n\nThe private spaceflight company Firefly Aerospace will attempt its first-ever moon landing in the wee hours of this morning (March 2) and you'll be able to see it live, but you do need to know when and where to watch. Luckily for you, we've got it covered.\n\nFirefly Aerospace's robotic Blue Ghost lander is scheduled to land on the moon on Sunday no earlier than 3:34 a.m. EST (0834 GMT) when it touches down on the vast Sea of Crises (or Mare Crisium). You'll be able to watch the landing live on this page, courtesy of NASA and Firefly Aerospace, starting about an hour before the landing attempt.\n\nThe $93.3 million Blue Ghost launched on Jan. 15 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying 10 NASA experiments as part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, program. If all goes well, the probe will spend two weeks studying the lunar surface, but first it has to land safely. Read on for the exact timing of Blue Ghost's moon landing and what it will do on the lunar surface. And check out this awesome Blue Ghost video of the moon during a recent orbit.\n\n\n\nFirefly Aerospace is currently targeting a 3:34 a.m. EST landing for the Blue Ghost lander (it will be 2:34 a.m. CST at the company's central Texas headquarters), but the landing sequence itself begins much earlier.\n\n\"Our landing event kind of takes place, really, over about an hour,\" Ray Allensworth, Firefly Aerospace's spacecraft program director, told Space.com's Mike Wall in an interview. \"Several hours before the actual event is where we will send the commands to the lander.\"\n\nThose commands will set the stage for a deorbit and landing process that will take about 63 minutes, starting with a so-called descent orbit insertion burn while the lander is 62 miles (100 kilometers) above the lunar surface. The lander will then coast down to an altitude of just over 12 miles (20 km), then fire its engines in a \"powered descent initialization\" (or PDI) burn.\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!\n\n\"PDI until landing is fully autonomous, so our onboard software packages will fully take control of the lander,\" Allensworth said, adding that Blue Ghost's onboard navigation system, cameras and rangefinders will take over to find a safe spot to land.\n\n\"So that 12 to 13 minutes is going to be a little bit nail-biting, but it is autonomous,\" she added.\n\nEvent\n\nTime (L=Landing)\n\nDescent Orbit Insertion\n\nL-63 minutes, 100 km above moon\n\nCoast Phase\n\nL-62 minutes, down to 20 km\n\nD'Souza Guidance\n\nL-11 minutes, down to 500 meters\n\nTerminal Guidance\n\nL-100 seconds, down to 10 meters\n\nLanding Guidance\n\nL-11 seconds, final descent\n\nTouchdown!\n\nL-0 seconds, on the moon\n\nYes, you can definitetly watch Blue Ghost attempt to land on the moon in real time, in livestreams from NASA and Firefly Aerospace.\n\nNASA's livestream of the landing will begin about an hour before launch at 2:30 a.m. EST (0730 GMT) and will run through the landing. You can watch live on the NASA+ streaming service and the NASA YouTube channel. It's NASA's livestream that Space.com will carry on this page, as well as on our front page.\n\nFirefly Aerospace, meanwhile, is offering daily Blue Ghost mission updates on its website and has set up its own YouTube feed for landing day. That livestream will begin at 2:20 a.m. EST (0720 GMT).\n\nNo matter which YouTube feed you watch, the Blue Ghost landing attempt could be a nail-biting experience, given it's the first of its kind for Firefly Aerospace. Still, the spacecraft has performed smoothly on its 45-day trip to the moon.\n\n\"I think with each burn that we've done, we've started kind of gaining confidence, especially because some of our burns have had such extreme precision,\" Allensworth. \"We're like, 'Oh, okay, we did do good. Like, we are prepared. It is going well.\"\n\n\n\nFirefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander will touch down in a vast impact basin on the moon's near side, the side that faces Earth, called Mare Crisium (the Sea of Crises).\n\nMare Crisium is a basalt plain that covers about 68,000 square miles (176,000 square kilometers) of the moon, making it about the size of the U.S. state of Missouri, according to NASA.\n\n\"It is the scar left behind when a massive asteroid impacted the lunar surface several billion years ago, and the crater flooded with dark, igneous lava,\" NASA wrote in an overview. Blue Ghost is targeting a spot on a low volcanic dome called Mons Latreille inside the basin. Scientists suspect the region is unique from the Apollo landing sites visited by astronauts in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and could yield new discoveries about the moon's composition.\n\nAllensworth said that Blue Ghost will target a zone about 328 feet (100 meters) long, \"where NASA's like, 'We're cool if you land anywhere in here.'\"\n\n\n\nThere are 10 NASA payloads riding on Blue Ghost, all of them fixed to the spacecraft, which stands 6.6 feet (2 meters) tall and is 11.5 feet (3.5 m) wide. The payloads weigh about 330 pounds (150 kilograms) altogether. Here's a a short look at what they are, but for a deeper dive, check out our story about what's onboard Blue Ghost.\n\nBlue Ghost is not designed to last forever on the moon.\n\nIt will take 45 days for the lander to reach the lunar surface, but the probe is only designed to last one lunar day, the equivalent of about 14 Earth days. That allows the NASA payloads on the solar-powered Blue Ghost to make their science observations during the lunar daytime, before the long night covers the region in darkness and chill.\n\nBut it should be an eventful two weeks, which will end just after a total lunar eclipse on March 14 turns the moon blood red to observers on Earth. It will look quite different to Blue Ghost.\n\n\"On March 14, Firefly expects to capture high-definition imagery of a total eclipse when the Earth blocks the sun above the moon’s horizon,\" Firefly Aerospace wrote in an overview. \"Blue Ghost will then capture the lunar sunset on March 16, providing data on how lunar dust levitates due to solar influences and creates a lunar horizon glow first documented by Eugene Cernan on Apollo 17.\"\n\nThe moon lander should last only a few hours into the lunar night before shutting down, Firefly Aerospace said.\n\nFirefly Aerospace is hoping for the best with Blue Ghost's planned moon landing, but if the company isn't able to touch down on time at Mare Crisium, it may have another chance.\n\nWhile the target time for the Blue Ghost moon landing is 3:34 a.m. EST (0834 GMT), it is possible that something may come up before the lander leaves orbit that could cause a delay. If that happens, flight controllers could delay the landing and fly around the moon a couple of more times.\n\nIf either of the two final descent and landing burns \"isn't perfectly executed on the first try, we will have a chance to go around the moon again on both of those burns, to do another orbit and try again,\" Allensworth said. \"Which could delay our landing time by one to two hours.\"\n\nThat decision will likely be made in real time as Blue Ghost orbits the moon at an altitude of about 62 miles (100 km). It should take the lander about 63 minutes to reach the lunar surface once it begins its descent.\n\nEditor's note: Visit Space.com for the latest news on Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost mission and tune in on March 2 for our landing livestream and coverage.

    "title": "25 biggest space conspiracy theories: Debunked",
    "date": "17 January 2025",
    "content": "The internet is absolutely full of myths and urban legends about space and just about everything else, so readers must be a skeptical these days.\n\nFrom claims of aliens crashing on Earth and UFOs being hidden on military bases, to Mars being abnormally large and the moon turning green, space tends to attract some outlandish or at least highly unproven claims that should be vetted carefully.\n\nHere are some of the biggest space myths and conspiracy theories that just won't go away.\n\n\n\nTwelve NASA astronauts walked on the moon between 1969 and 1972, but in the decades since Apollo 11 astronauts first set foot on the moon, many theories have been put forward claiming that the whole Apollo program was staged. However, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has since released photos of the landing sites as they appear on the lunar surface many years later.\n\nSome of the questions moon landing deniers ask are \"Why are there no stars in the sky in the moonwalkers' photos? Why are the U.S. flags fluttering on the surface? Why do you see footprints in the pictures, but no marks from the lunar modules that landed there?\"\n\nIt turns out those questions are easy to answer than you may think.\n\nThere are no stars in the sky for the same reason you don't see stars during the day on Earth, according to NASA: The bright glow of daylight on the surface washes them out.\n\nU.S. flags planted into the lunar soil had metal rods sewn in them to appear as though they were moving, according to NASA. Without these wires, the flag would have hung straight down, making for a pretty lackluster photo prop.\n\nAnd the lunar modules, though heavier, didn't put prominent marks in the surface in some places because their mass was more evenly distributed than the astronauts' weight was in their boots.\n\n\n\nSome people actually believe NASA's whole function is not to explore space, but to generate space-related hoaxes. (The Apollo moon landing is a famous example that we'll explore in the next slide.) People who believe this conspiracy, sometimes flagged with the hashtag \"#NASAhoax\" on social media, will say that amazing space pictures of Mars, Pluto and even Earth are fake, computer-generated imagery (CGI).\n\nTop 10 Apollo Hoax Theories\n\n8 ways life would get weird on a flat Earth\n\nQuiz: Mars Myths and Misconceptions\n\n7 Things Most Often Mistaken for UFOs\n\nPhotos: The search for water on Mars\n\nNASA was formed in 1958 \"to provide for research into problems of flight within and outside the Earth's atmosphere, and for other purposes,\" according to the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, which then-president Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law shortly after the start of the space race against the Soviet Union.\n\nSince then, NASA has launched hundreds of satellites into orbit around Earth, the moon and several other worlds. In fact, NASA spacecraft have orbited, flown by or landed on every planet in the solar system. NASA also sends astronauts into orbit, where they conduct research at the International Space Station (ISS).If you're not convinced, you are free to travel to Florida's Space Coast to watch a rocket launch for yourself. It's also quite easy to see the space station and other satellites with your own eyes with the help of a satellite tracker.\n\n\n\nThis myth is so popular that there is even a group named after it: the Flat Earth Society. Members of the organization argue that the horizon is always at eye level, which they say would not be possible if the Earth were round. They also say there is no full movie of the Earth rotating from space — which is not true, as NASA has published multiple videos taken from satellites, including a live video of Earth from the ISS, which orbits our planet 16 times per day.One way of demonstrating to yourself that the Earth is round is to consider how orbits of satellites work. Satellites constantly \"fall\" around the Earth as they are pulled around by our planet's gravity; they just need to be traveling fast enough at a high enough altitude to not slam into the atmosphere. Or, you can look at the amazing pictures taken by astronauts at the ISS.\n\n\n\nIn April 2016, the New York Post tweeted, \"A newly discovered planet could destroy Earth as soon as this month.\" The newspaper was referring to Planet Nine, a theoretical planet at the edge of the solar system. An accompanying video also claimed that the new planet would be throwing all sorts of asteroids and comets at Earth, which would supposedly end up pummeling our planet.Although the existence of a ninth planet has not been confirmed, astronomers are actively looking for one to help explain motions of some objects in the icy Kuiper Belt, a vast region of icy objects beyond Neptune. If the planet is actually found, the planet will pose no threat to us, according to the California Institute of Technology's Mike Brown (who is one of the original backers of the Planet Nine theory).\n\n\n\nThe 1996 movie \"Independence Day\" is one of the main sources of the Area 51 hoax, which claims that aliens and their technology — recovered from crashed flying saucers — are being studied secretly at a classified military base about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of Las Vegas in the Nevada desert. Some people in the area around the base claim that they have seen strange lights or objects flying in or out of this area.While the testing and development conducted at Area 51 is classified, the U.S. government has acknowledged its existence (although the CIA officially calls it \"Homey Airport\" or \"Groom Lake\").\n\nA part of Edwards Air Force Base, the area was a known location for high-technology airplane flights in the 1960s and 1970s. It first served as a proving ground for Lockheed U-2 and A-12 OXCART spy planes as early as 1955. UFO sightings reported in the area were indeed unidentified objects, but only because the planes were top-secret — not because they were flown by aliens.\n\n\n\nConspiracy theorists say another dangerous planet is Nibiru, which was first mentioned in the 1976 book \"The Twelfth Planet,\" by Zecharia Sitchin. In the book, Sitchin translated ancient Sumerian cuneiform and claimed that the text is proof of a planet beyond Neptune called Nibiru that orbits the sun every 3,600 years.Years later, self-proclaimed psychic Nancy Lieder claimed to have communicated with extraterrestrials who said Nibiru would collide with Earth in 2003. When that didn't happen, the date was moved to 2012 (and linked, of course, with the 2012 doomsday predictions). Of course, the collision never occurred, the world didn't end in 2012 and no astronomer has ever found a planet on a collision course with Earth.\n\n\n\nIn 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft took a picture of what appeared to be a face on Mars. Immediately, some people said there must have been aliens on the Red Planet that left that face behind as evidence of their existence. NASA, however, pointed out that the suspected face is really just a pile of rocks casting shadows that resemble face-like features.NASA followed up with better-resolution pictures taken from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Mars Global Surveyor in 1998 and 2001, respectively. These new images made it quite clear that the \"face on Mars\" is nothing more than a trick of light and shadows on a completely normal Martian mound.\n\n\n\nIapetus is a moon of Saturn that looks somewhat like the infamous Death Star in the \"Star Wars\" franchise, with a large crater that resembles the fictional weapon's superlaser focus lens. The Death Star is a planet-killing machine that destroys entire worlds with its outrageously powerful laser. It was prominently featured in the 2016 movie \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,\" as well as in 1977's \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.\"A Daily Mail article published in May 2016 claimed Iapetus is an artificial object crafted by aliens. As \"evidence,\" the article cited a photo taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft in 2004. In the photo, there's a line around the moon's equator that resembles the equatorial trench around the Death Star.\n\nBut this line isn't nearly as interesting as the Death Star's trench, which houses the battle station's engines, thrusters and docking bays. That line is nothing more than a mountain ridge, and Iapetus is actually just made up of boring old rock and ice. Cassini has flown by the moon to take pictures several times without being blasted by deadly alien lasers.\n\nSaturn's moon Mimas, with it's giant crater Herschel, also looks surprisingly like the Death Star.\n\n\n\nSaturn's hexagon was first spotted when NASA's Voyager spacecraft flew by the giant, ringed planet in 1980. The bizarre, six-sided structure on the round planet's north pole caused quite the stir, because straight lines and polygons are not so common in nature.Immediately after the Voyager returned its first images of Saturn's strange feature, even stranger theories arose to explain it, including that it was somehow related to alien technology, or perhaps even was a gateway to hell. The hexagon is not artificial, but rather a weird-looking hurricane at Saturn's pole.\n\nNASA has done several flybys of this region with the Cassini spacecraft, studying the haze particles and other features of the storm, to try to learn more about its unusual properties.\n\n\n\nOriginating in 2003, the infamous Mars hoax asserts that Mars was closer to Earth than it had been in the 60,000 years prior, and that the planet will appear as large as the full moon. What started out as a misconstrued email turned into a recurring rumor that gets reshared every August and, naturally, has spread to social media as it became more popular. Although Mars is indeed relatively close to Earth in a cosmic sense, it will never be as large as the full moon. It will appear as a red dot in the sky, just as the ancient astronomers saw it. If you'd like to see Mars magnified, take out a telescope or look at one of NASA's spectacular Mars pictures.\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

    "date": "16 January 2025",
    "content": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — When a boy named Elliott found an alien in the classic 1982 film \"E.T.\" it offered easy answer to the question on every astronomer's mind: Are we alone in the universe? In reality, however, scientists have yet to solve that query.\n\nThat could soon change, thanks to a new NASA flagship telescope being designed to seek out strange new worlds that could support life as we know it. Called the Habitable Worlds Observatory, the telescope is so massive it may even need to ride a next-gen megarocket like SpaceX's Starship to reach space; it will also require new technological innovations to hunt for Earth's twin across the light-years. Yet, even with such hefty demands, this project was tapped as a top priority for NASA in the Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020 (Astro2020), an influential report that aims to set a roadmap for the astronomy community within the decade following its release.\n\n\"The question 'Are we alone?' is one of the most significant questions, not just in the history of science, but in the history of humanity, and we are at the precipice of actually having the tools and technologies that are required to tackle this question in a rigorous and scientific fashion,\" Giada Arney, the interim project scientist for the Habitable Worlds Observatory, told a crowd of scientists during a plenary talk here at the 245th American Astronomical Society meeting on Wednesday (Jan. 15). \"We might learn the answer to this question within our lifetimes, and the answer to that question is a discovery, the implications of which would ripple through future millennia.\"\n\nArney, a planetary scientist based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is working with a vast team of scientists to develop the Habitable Worlds Observatory into a powerful tool for astrophysics research and exoplanet discovery. Last summer, NASA opened a new program office at Goddard for the space telescope and announced it has earned $17.5 million in funding to explore some of the key technologies needed to bring the instrument to fruition. Now, the team is gearing up for a major science conference in late July to outline the science the Habitable Worlds Observatory could do.\n\n\"We're very early in the design phase of HWO,\" Arney said, using NASA's shorthand for the observatory. \"We're still iterating through a number of design concepts, so we don't know exactly how HWO is going to look when it launches.\"\n\nOne thing is for sure, though: It's going to be big.\n\nLee Feinberg, HWO's principal architect based at Goddard, said in a separate presentation that NASA is currently envisioning a massive space telescope nearly 20 feet (6 meters) wide, and suggested it could get as large as 26 feet (8 m). The Hubble Space Telescope, for comparison, has a 6.5-foot (2 m) aperture, he said.\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!\n\nEven the smallest version of HWO will need a huge rocket to haul it into space. Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket, which has a huge 23-foot (7 m) fairing, could fit the bill, Feinberg said.\n\n\"It would be really challenging to fit in that rocket from a mass perspective, but these are the kind of details that we're trying to understand,\" Feinberg said.\n\n\n\nFor larger versions of HWO, SpaceX's massive Starship — currently the world's tallest and most powerful rocket, with a nearly 30-foot (9 m) payload bay, is an option not just for launching the rocket, but also as a way to return to the observatory in space for periodic servicing, just as NASA space shuttle astronauts did with Hubble, according to early designs.\n\nThe space telescope will have four primary instruments, including a super-sensitive coronagraph that can detect Earth-size planets around distant stars. A prototype of its coronagraph should launch into orbit in 2026 on NASA's new Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Current HWO designs call for the coronagraph, a high-resolution imager, an advanced spectroscope and a fourth instrument yet to be determined.\n\n— 'Pale blue dot' planets like Earth may make up only 1% of potentially habitable worlds\n\n— Space dust could carry alien life across the galaxy, study suggests\n\n— Fermi Paradox: Where are the aliens?\n\nThe current plan for HWO is to launch the observatory sometime between 2030 and 2040 to catalog at least 25 Earth-like exoplanet candidates for biosignatures, or signs that life that could be present on those worlds. The oxygen, methane and ozone of modern Earth are examples of possible biosignatures, Arney said.\n\nIf HWO successfully finds those signs of life, it would be a watershed moment for humanity's understanding of how common life might be in the universe. The reverse, however, is also possible. If HWO samples 25 exo-Earth candidates and comes up empty, that could be seen as the first \"upper-limit\" on the frequency of life beyond Earth, Arney said.\n\n\"HWO will either tell us we are not alone, if there are bio signatures that can be observed on an exo-Earth candidate orbiting a nearby star, or it will tell us for the very first time just how alone we are,\" she said. \"Either answer would be profound, and either answer would change the way we see ourselves in relation to the rest of the universe.\"\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

    "date": "27 February 2025",
    "content": "The \"Starlink satellite train\" has become a captivating sight for skywatchers, offering a glimpse of the future of global internet coverage. This dazzling spectacle occurs shortly after SpaceX launches a new batch of its Starlink satellites — part of the megaconstellation that provides high-speed internet worldwide. On clear nights, you may spot these satellites as they streak across the sky, resembling a string of bright, evenly spaced lights.\n\nWhile these satellites concern astronomers due to their impact on observations, they’ve captured the public's imagination. The Starlink satellite train is often mistaken for UFOs because of its otherworldly appearance. However, this striking formation is short-lived; as the satellites ascend to their operational orbit at 340 miles (550 kilometers), they disperse and blend into the starry backdrop. If you’re hoping to spot this celestial procession, timing is everything — so keep an eye on launch schedules and visibility forecasts.\n\nRelated: Track the ISS: How and where to see it\n\nThe megaconstellation developed by the private spaceflight company SpaceX may grow to as many as 42,000 satellites in orbit, according to the science news website NASA Spaceflight.\n\nAs of Feb. 27, 2025, there are 7,086 Starlink satellites in orbit, of which 7,052 are working, according to Astronomer Jonathan McDowell, who tracks the constellation on his website.\n\nGiven the high numbers of regular Starlink launches (sometimes multiple times a week), there is ample opportunity to set your sights on catching a glimpse of the infamous \"Starlink train\".\n\nHowever, it should be noted that Starlink satellites are not as visible nowadays compared to when they first started to be deployed back in 2019. This is due to efforts such as the Starlink VisorSat program which aims to darken the satellites so as to not interfere as much with astronomical observations.\n\n\n\nTo find out when you can see a Starlink satellite near you, check out this Starlink locator website that details when and where to look for your next Starlink viewing opportunity.\n\nIf you want to see where all of the Starlink satellites are located in real-time this Starlink map shows the global coverage of each Starlink satellite as well as information on how many are currently in service, inactive or have burned up in Earth's atmosphere.\n\nOur list of the best stargazing apps may help you with your Starlink satellite viewing planning as well as our photographing Starlink satellites guide.\n\nRelated: How to tell the difference between meteor and satellite streaks in photos\n\nWe can see Starlink satellites only when they reflect sunlight; they do not possess lights of their own.\n\nThe vast and ever-increasing numbers of satellites from SpaceX and other private space companies, such as OneWeb, suggest that light pollution and other issues stemming from these megaconstellations may continue, and advocates have called for greater regulations from government agencies.\n\nRelated: Megaconstellations could destroy astronomy and there's no easy fix\n\nThe Starlink satellite train is usually visible shortly after the satellites have been deployed when they are at their lowest orbit. Starlink satellites travel very fast and complete one orbit of Earth every 90 minutes which means you can sometimes see them within just two hours of a previous sighting.\n\nIf Starlink satellites fail to make orbit, they then return to Earth in dramatic fashion, burning up as they go. This happened on Feb. 4, 2022, when a freshly launched batch of Starlinks encountered the effects of a big geomagnetic storm. They were sent crashing back to Earth over the coming days and a remarkable video captured some of the space debris burning up over Puerto Rico on Feb. 7, 2022.\n\nRead about how SpaceX's next generation of Starlink satellites (Starlink 2.0) have undergone a series of upgrades to reduce interference for the global astronomical community in this article published on the science communication site Interesting Engineering.

    "content": "Varda Space has successfully landed a reentry capsule in Australia, delivering critical data that could advance in-space manufacturing and hypersonic technologies.\n\nCalifornia-based startup Varda's Winnebago-2 (W-2) capsule launched along with 130 other payloads on Jan. 14 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, on the Transporter 12 rideshare mission. After six weeks in orbit, the capsule made a fiery plunge through Earth's atmosphere, landing Feb. 28 at Koonibba Test Range in South Australia, which is operated by Southern Launch.\n\nW-2 contained a spectrometer from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and a Varda enhanced pharmaceutical reactor for the company's in-orbit manufacturing plans. The capsule used a heat shield with a Thermal Protection System (TPS) developed in collaboration with NASA's Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley.\n\n\n\nThe spectrometer, the Optical Sensing of Plasmas in the Reentry Environment (OSPREE) sensor, is expected to provide the first-ever in situ optical emission measurements of the reentry environment past Mach 15, according to Varda. The instrument is part of a longer-term partnership between Varda and AFRL for testing hypersonic systems and reentry technologies.\n\nRelated: Private Varda Space capsule returns to Earth with space-grown antiviral drug aboard\n\n\"We are ecstatic to have W-2 back on our home planet safely and are proud to support significant reentry research for our government partners as we continue building a thriving foundation for economic expansion to low Earth orbit,\" Will Bruey, CEO of Varda Space Industries, said in a statement.\n\nThe 265-pound (120 kilograms) capsule was supported in orbit by a Pioneer satellite bus built by Rocket Lab, which provided power, communications, propulsion and other necessary capabilities.\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!\n\n— 'Them space drugs cooked real good:' Varda Space just made an HIV medicine in Earth orbit\n\n— See Varda Space's private in-space manufacturing capsule's historic return to Earth in photos\n\n— In-space manufacturing could help humanity fight climate change, startup says\n\nThe successful return to Earth of W-2 also marked a breakthrough for the Australian space sector, according to officials.\n\n\"This return highlights the opportunity for Australia to become a responsible launch and return hub for the global space community — capitalizing off the geographic advantages of our expansive continent,\" said Enrico Palermo, head of the Australian Space Agency, in a statement.\n\nThe W-2 landing came a year after the company's first mission, W-1, which landed in Utah in February 2024. The mission saw W-1 in orbit for eight months before delivering to Earth crystals of an antiviral drug that were grown in orbit.\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

    "content": "Step aside, Darth Vader. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Joint EUV Coronal Diagnostic Investigation, also known as JEDI, has an even bigger task to balance the force in space, giving researchers a brand-new view of the sun's atmosphere.\n\nThe instrument will be a state-of-the-art multi-thermal EUV imager that will include two telescopes, specific to studying the solar wind and extreme space weather events. It is planned to take flight on the European Space Agency (ESA)'s Vigil space weather mission in 2031, and will allow scientists to get an even deeper understand of space weather by studying the sun's atmosphere in a less-explored region and at a different angle; at Lagrange Point 5 (L5).\n\nThere are areas in space where there's a happy medium of both gravitational and centripetal forces, which are known as Lagrange points. At these locations, spacecraft such as satellites can stay put and remain stagnant while taking observations without being pulled away in different directions. This location is a rare spot to park a probe, as it's trailing Earth's orbit by roughly 60 degrees. It's been around for billions of years, located nearly 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) away from our planet, and also is a solid point to call home; even asteroids remain almost frozen in time in the same location!\n\n“Any time you go to a new place, you have new discoveries, and I think there's going to be great discoveries we're going to get both with the new location at L5 and with the new capability of JEDI. The observations we will get from the Vigil mission will provide the side view of solar storms as they're coming to earth,” Don Hassler, the project lead at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told Space.com. “When you're observing these solar storms from Earth, you don't really see the ones that are coming directly at you because they're halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which is a term meaning they're not as easily identifiable. So, you'll be able to see these from this mission and it'll be the ones that actually hit Earth. You'll be able to see the storm that's coming right before it produces an aurora.”\n\n\n\nThe two telescopes that make up JEDI, the Space Weather Operational Coronal Imager (SWOC) and the Enhanced Wide-angle Observations of the Corona (EWOC), will work in tandem to capture high resolution images to paint a picture of the different parts of the sun's atmosphere. Think of it this way; when you take photos of the same object from multiple angles and from different distances, it helps you understand the entire story of what you're seeing in front of you. JEDI is helping fill in the gaps of data not observed by other space weather instruments, such as the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment (LASCO) instrument aboard NASA and the ESA's SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) and the Compact Coronagraph-1 (CCOR-1) aboard NOAA's GOES-19.\n\n“We're so used to looking at coronagraph images with the occulting disk that we kind of ignore the fact that there's stuff under there that we don't see. JEDI has the ability to study the mesoscale structure, which is the backbone of the quiet solar wind. We're going to be able to link these EUV images on the disk and fill that space from the coronagraph,” Hassler said. “The solar wind is structured basically because of how it is formed, and sun's middle corona is the link between all the structure that we see on the surface, on the disk, with the structure that we see out in the corona. We're going to be imaging this region on a regular basis with JEDI producing images of this middle Corona on a 10-minute basis.”\n\n— New NASA coronagraph will measure temperature, speed of solar wind from ISS\n\n— Space weather: What is it and how is it predicted?\n\n— Solar wind: What is it and how does it affect Earth?\n\nBy having an extra pair of eyes on the sun, forecasters will be able to tap into information 24/7, and begin to learn more about solar flares as they occur. This will contribute to improved space weather forecasts so advisories and warnings can be issued with more lead time, benefitting both end users that could be impacted by solar storms on Earth and even more time to plan ahead to view auroras that may happen at lower latitudes from stronger geomagnetic storms.\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated to clarify that the distance to Lagrange Point 5 (L5) is 93 million miles (150 million kilometers).\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

    "date": "",
    "content": "At the European Space Agency’s technical heart in the Netherlands, engineers have spent the last five months unboxing and testing elements of Europe’s next space science mission. With the two main parts now joined together, Smile is well on its way to being ready to launch by the end of 2025.\n\nSmile will give humankind its first complete look at how Earth reacts to streams of particles and bursts of radiation from the Sun. By improving our understanding of the solar wind, solar storms and space weather, Smile will fill a stark gap in our understanding of the Solar System. To make sure that the mission is a success, our teams are working tirelessly behind the scenes.\n\nWatch the video below to get a glimpse into what we’ve been up to recently. [Text continues after video]\n\nAs a 50–50 collaboration between ESA and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Smile is a truly international effort. Pieces of the spacecraft have been built by teams across Europe and China, and are now finally united at ESA’s technical heart (ESTEC).\n\nSmile’s crucial ‘payload module’ – which contains three of its four scientific instruments – was built by Airbus in Spain on behalf of ESA. This major piece was the first to arrive at ESTEC in September last year.\n\nThe arrival of the payload module kicked off a year-long integration and testing phase, where colleagues from ESA, Airbus and CAS are all working together at ESTEC to prepare the spacecraft for flight. Step one was to put the payload module through a gruelling test regime to make sure that it was absolutely ready to work perfectly as a complete unit in the challenging space environment.\n\nThe process was not always smooth sailing. On 21 November 2024, Airbus and ESA teams looked on nervously as the spacecraft’s 3 m-long magnetometer boom refused to lock into place. Engineers entered into intense discussion and very quickly discovered the cause: a bundle of cables that was too stiff and not mounted correctly.\n\nThe team fixed the issue immediately by loosening the bundle and mounting it slightly differently. They successfully released the boom again the following day. A round of applause filled the room when the boom clicked into place. Click on the image below to find out more about the magnetometer boom and the little instrument that sits at its end.\n\n“Overall, the arrival and testing of the payload module went really well and we are confident that the instruments on board are going to collect fantastic scientific data once in space,” says ESA’s David Agnolon, who is managing the European side of the Smile project. “This is the first time that ESA and China are collaborating on a project of this type and scale, and we have already overcome many challenges thanks to an excellent spirit of cooperation on both sides.”\n\nOne of the biggest challenges that David refers to relates to working with colleagues in another continent during the COVID-19 era. In 2022, for example, Airbus sent a model of the Smile payload module to China for testing. But because of travel restrictions, Airbus and ESA colleagues were not able to support the testing of their own hardware, and the teams had to resort to ‘online engineering’.\n\nFortunately, colleagues from around the world are now able to work harmoniously at ESTEC, sharing cultures and traditions as well as engineering knowledge.\n\nOn 9 December 2024, Smile’s ‘platform’ arrived on a dedicated flight from Shanghai, together with 15 engineers and managers from CAS. The platform contains the fourth scientific instrument, as well as everything else that the spacecraft needs to function, including the modules responsible for powering, steering and controlling the spacecraft.\n\nGetting Smile’s platform to the Netherlands was no easy feat. It was the first time a spacecraft platform was exported to Europe from China. Special authorisations were needed, for example from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, Air China Cargo, the Dutch and Chinese civil aviation authorities and ESA’s own transport company.\n\nThe arrival of the platform was ultimately delayed because of the huge amount of documentation involved, in particular for the ammonia in the heat pipes labelled as ‘dangerous goods’.\n\nFinally, on 21 January 2025, Smile’s payload module could be connected to the platform with 120 bolts. This delicate procedure required perfect precision, with about twenty people from ESA, CAS and Airbus surrounding the spacecraft, fully focused on the task in hand. The engineers wore white cleanroom suits, hair and beard nets, and shoe coverings to protect the spacecraft from dust and dirt.\n\nAs they say, the devil is in the detail, and the team quickly encountered an obstacle. They realised that when they would place the payload module onto the platform, some cables would slightly cover up the bolts, making the attachment tricky.\n\nEngineers put their heads together (literally – the cleanroom environment can be busy!) and quickly came up with a solution. They made a last-minute adjustment to the integration procedure, deciding to place some bolts before lifting the payload module, to ensure that the later attachment would go as smoothly as possible.\n\nFinally, the payload module was ready to move. Engineers attached hooks and used a hoisting device to lift it very slowly, at about a centimetre per second. Smile’s ‘assembly, integration and testing’ manager from ESA, Benjamin Vanoutryve, looked on attentively.\n\n“This moment was finally happening, after so many years of meticulous preparation work on two sides of the world. In just a moment, we would finally see ‘our’ Smile spacecraft as a real object for the first time,” says Benjamin.\n\nAn Airbus engineer used a remote-control belt to carry the payload module over to the platform, and lower it slowly, millimetre by millimetre, to line up perfectly with the platform below. When the two were separated by just 20 cm, Airbus handed over to CAS, who took care of the very final attachment. CAS and Airbus colleagues in safety harnesses up on aerial platforms closely monitored the operation.\n\nAs the payload module was lowered into place, the engineers could start bolting the two parts of the spacecraft together. For the first time, the teams are now dealing with a complete spacecraft.\n\nSo, what’s next for this little spacecraft with big ambitions?\n\nFrom this month, Smile will be tested for the first time as a complete unit. Engineers will have to get it to pass tough checks with flying colours before being allowed out on its own, including making sure that the entire system can operate properly in the vacuum of space, that the different parts of the spacecraft don’t create too much electromagnetic disturbance for other parts, and that the violent launch won’t shake the spacecraft apart.\n\nAirbus engineers will continue to support the CAS and ESA teams throughout the entire test campaign to ensure that the platform and payload module work perfectly well together and help to resolve any issues.\n\nBy September 2025, Smile should be ready to go, and our ESTEC colleagues will wave goodbye as it ships off to Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana. From there, the team will prepare Smile for launch on a Vega-C rocket, hopefully by the end of this year.\n\nFollow the latest mission news via esa.int/smile\n\nThank you for liking\n\nYou have already liked this page, you can only like it once!"

    "title": "Devastating floods in Spain witnessed by satellites",
    "date": "",
    "content": "Torrential rainfall causing deadly flash floods has hit southern and eastern Spain in regions including the Costa del Sol, where the city of Malaga is located, and Valencia in the east. As these areas struggle to cope with the aftermath, satellite technology has played a crucial role in assessing the damages of the affected areas.\n\nThe article is being updated as new satellite images become available.\n\nThe storms concentrated over the Magro, Turia and the Poyo river basins, releasing torrents of muddy water that turned village streets into rivers, destroyed homes and swept away bridges and vehicles. Over 200 people have lost their lives with thousands displaced and many still missing. Valencia’s coastal region was particularly hard-hit, receiving a year’s worth of rain in just eight hours, according to Spain’s national weather agency, Aemet.\n\nAemet reported that the extreme rainfall resulted from a high-altitude, low-pressure weather system isolated from the jet stream. Known locally as DANA, these storm systems form when cold fronts encounter warm, humid air masses, such as over the Mediterranean Sea. The storms can remain stationary before dissipating, increasing the potential for severe flooding.\n\nEarth observation imagery and data are an important resource for emergency services, providing crucial information for near real-time response, post-event analysis and damage assessment. US Landsat-8 satellite images captured on 30 October were the first to illustrate the scale of the disaster, showing the drastic transformation of the landscape.\n\nThe Copernicus Sentinel-2 images above show the scale of the Valencia flooding disaster and the drastic transformation of the landscape.\n\nSentinel-1 radar images from 19 and 31 October illustrate the severe flooding of the Albufera National Park due to the discharge of the Magro, Turia and Poyo rivers. This park is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the east and encroaches on densely populated neighbourhoods to the west.\n\nThe Copernicus Emergency Rapid Mapping Service (EMS) was activated by the Directorate-General for Civil Protection and Emergencies (Dirección General de Protección Civil y Emergencias) on 29 October to create maps showing the extent and severity of the flooding in affected areas.\n\nSeveral maps have been produced and published thus far, the first was published on 31 October, based on the GeoEye acquisition from that morning.\n\nFurther analysis, along with a WorldView image acquired on the same day, reveals that more than 4100 hectares and 3906 buildings were impacted, while more than 60,000 people, around 15 km of railways, and 531 km of roads were potentially impacted in the area of Horta Sud.\n\nAn analysis of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery acquired on 31 October over Valencia province produced a map on 2 November showing around 15,633 hectares of flooded area and approximately 190,000 people potentially affected.\n\nSpain’s Civil Protection Agency also activated the International Charter ‘Space and Major Disasters’, which combines Earth observation assets from 17 space agencies and seven commercial data distributors from around the globe, to provide additional observations and analysis of the disaster zones.\n\nThe Charter provides this data on a best-effort, no-cost basis to aid in the response phase of major disasters. The Charter was activated on 1 November and it was agreed that the Copernicus EMS and the Charter would collaborate on this activation through the established data sharing agreements.\n\nIn addition to CEMS, several organisations have agreed to support the Charter activation through the provision of value-added products.\n\nThese organisations include LIST in Luxembourg, SERTIT in France, and MBRSC in the United Arab Emirates. These products compliment those generated by the EMS by providing a more detailed analysis of the situation.\n\n“Space-based observation plays an invaluable role during natural disasters like the recent floods in Spain,” said Simonetta Cheli, Director of Earth Observation Programmes at ESA.\n\n“Our mission is to rapidly coordinate with partners through the International Charter and the Copernicus Emergency Mapping Service to deliver critical, real-time Earth observation data to aid emergency teams on the ground. We are committed to supporting rescue and relief efforts, providing the data needed to assess the damage and ensure timely response in affected communities.”\n\nBeyond mapping damaged areas, satellites can help monitor the environmental conditions in an area affected by a hydrometeorological hazard such as the emergency that hit Spain. Data from ESA’s SMOS mission on 29 October further illustrated the situation, showing saturated ground around Valencia and other regions on the day of the floods.\n\nThe SMOS satellite, designed to measure global soil moisture over land and salinity over oceans, uses an innovative radiometer in the L-band microwave range to produce 'brightness temperature' images, which help derive soil moisture maps—an essential resource in the aftermath of such disasters.\n\nVery high-resolution optical images captured by Pléiades Neo, an ESA Third Party Mission, on 31 October, reveal the extensive damage from the Valencia floods in extreme detail. Data from Pléiades Neo were also provided to the Disaster Charter activation, thanks to the Centre national d'études spatiales (CNES).\n\nThe multi-temporal image featured below was captured by ESA Third Party Mission Cosmo-SkyMed and has been processed in a way to highlight flooded areas in the Valencia region in shades of blue.\n\nThank you for liking\n\nYou have already liked this page, you can only like it once!"

    "title": "Nord Stream methane leak far bigger than estimated",
    "date": "",
    "content": "The methane emitted in 2022 by the damaged Nord Stream gas pipelines was more than double the volume estimated at the time, according to a study published in Nature.\n\nThe leak is among the biggest ever methane releases related to human activity and occurred when the two Nord Stream pipelines were ruptured at the end of September 2022.\n\nThe study puts the likely methane volume that escaped from the gas pipes under the Baltic Sea in a range between 445 000 and 485 000 tonnes. Earlier studies put the amount much lower, between 75 000 and 230 000 tonnes. The study was coordinated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\n\nThe researchers used data from several satellites including the Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Copernicus Sentinel-2 missions, as well as the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instrument on Eumetsat’s MetOp-B satellite. Data from ESA third-party missions, Landsat 8 and GHGSat, were also used. In addition to the satellite data, the study looked at sources including atmospheric in-situ instrumentation, marine observations, aerial measurements and engineering estimates.\n\nThe study compared the datasets with models of the pipeline emission rates caused by the leaks. Stephen Harris, a scientist at UNEP’s International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO), explains, “Satellite observations were just one component of a broader set of measurement approaches, which together enabled the study to provide a comprehensive and accurate assessment of methane emissions from the event – highlighting the importance of integrating diverse, complementary methane measurement methods.”\n\nThe research, conducted by 70 scientists from 30 research organisations, was part funded by two ESA Earth Observation Science for Society initiatives: MethaneCamp and Methane+. According to Edward Malina, an ESA Earth Observation Atmosphere Scientist, “This study shows the benefits and importance of methane concentrations provided by satellites on a regular basis.”\n\nAnd Diego Fernandez Prieto, Head of ESA’s Earth Observation Science Section, noted, “Sustained ESA support to scientific advances on methane measurements from satellites have improved our ability to characterise methane leaks globally. I believe this is a good example of how science is transferred into climate action as we are now better equipped to monitor progress and respond to the Global Methane Pledge.”\n\nThe study was coordinated by the IMEO, which is also a core implementing partner of the Global Methane Pledge.\n\nThe upper estimate for the Nord Stream leak would dwarf the world’s previous largest methane leak. This is estimated at 109 000 tonnes of methane released from the Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Facility in the US, between October 2015 and February 2016. Despite the huge volumes emitted during one-off events, Stephen Harris points out that the Nord Stream release was just 0.1% of global human-caused methane emissions in 2022.\n\nHe explained, “This is equivalent to only two days of the oil and gas industry’s annual methane emissions. This highlights the vast number of other human-caused methane sources that still require global mitigation efforts.”\n\nThe International Energy Agency estimates that the production and use of fossil fuels resulted in close to 120 million tonnes of methane emissions in 2023, while a further 10 million tonnes came from bioenergy. Methane emissions have remained at this level since they reached a peak in 2019.\n\nPrior to this study there was significant uncertainty regarding the impact of the methane release by the Nord Stream leaks in 2022. The study published in Nature provides the first coherent and accurate assessment of its impact.\n\nSo why the huge difference in the estimated size of the leak in this study? The initial estimates, according to Stephen Harris, including those from UNEP’s IMEO, were based on data from a limited number of studies, many of which relied on incomplete sources available at the time. “Furthermore, these estimates varied widely, each capturing only part of the story from a different perspective. This study presents the first updated estimate that incorporates all available data to account for every aspect of the emission event: the methane present in the pipeline before and after the ruptures, the amount dissolved in the Baltic Sea, and the portion ultimately released into the atmosphere. Satellite-based measurements played a crucial role in understanding the latter.”\n\nThank you for liking\n\nYou have already liked this page, you can only like it once!"

    "content": "A compelling collection of images that illustrates humanity’s efforts to mitigate the far-reaching impacts of violent solar outbursts has been unveiled in London.\n\nThe exhibition – created by photographer and storyteller Max Alexander – features photos of instruments that will be carried by ESA’s Vigil mission, which is expected to transform Europe’s ability to forecast space weather following its launch in 2031.\n\nAbout 150 million km separate Earth from its closest star but the planet is still well within the vast region of space, known as the heliosphere, that is dominated by the huge amounts energetic material and intense radiation emitted by the Sun.\n\nSolar flares, coronal mass ejections, solar wind and geomagnetic storms can cause changes to the space environment, influencing Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field.\n\nMost of the time these phenomena are harmless – and occasionally trigger stunning displays of aurora borealis – but extreme events have the potential to disrupt infrastructure on Earth and in space, including satellite telecommunications, global positioning systems, and power grids.\n\nMax Alexander says, “The Sun gives us life, but it can also expose the vulnerabilities of the increasingly complex, intertwined systems on which we rely. With the perspectives of leading experts, my aim is to highlight this duality as we build the resilience needed to coexist with the power of our closest star.”\n\nGiven the potential economic consequences of extreme solar activity, ESA is expanding Europe’s capability to forecast space weather, as demonstrated by the development of Vigil.\n\nMatthew West, Vigil Mission Scientist at ESA, explains, “From its unique vantage point in deep space, Vigil will detect what happens on the Sun’s surface days before it rotates into view from Earth and satellites on the Sun-Earth line.\n\n“As the first mission to permanently observe the Sun and Earth from the side, its instruments can detect how space weather and the causes of geomagnetic storms move from the Sun towards our planet. This greatly improves our understanding and provides a much more precise and actionable forecast.”\n\nAirbus UK is the prime contractor for the spacecraft and several of its instruments are being developed under the leadership of British institutes, including its magnetometer and its plasma analyser, both of which are featured in the photography collection.\n\nVigil will greatly enhance ESA’s existing space weather network, managed from its mission control centre in Germany, which draws on observations from multiple sources to provide actionable information on solar activity.\n\nGiuseppe Mandorlo, Vigil Project Manager at ESA, says, “The recent Lloyds of London report on economic impacts due to a major solar event estimated losses of up to $2.4 trillion over 5 years, which highlights the scale and long-lasting effects of such an event.\n\n“The forecasting and ‘nowcasting’ space weather services that Vigil will enable will be essential if we are to mitigate the impacts to our critical services and daily life. Vigil is an investment in protecting our infrastructure and people.”\n\nAlexander concludes, “Solar storms have struck our planet before, and we know they will again – it is just a matter of when. This exhibition tells the story of how humanity is using its ingenuity and knowledge to develop the tools protect itself from such an event.”\n\n‘Life in the Sun’s Atmosphere: from Disruption to Resilience’ is on show in London at Lloyd’s, the world’s leading insurance and reinsurance marketplace, from 3 to 14 March 2025.\n\nThank you for liking\n\nYou have already liked this page, you can only like it once!"

    "title": "Ariane 6 takes flight for the second time",
    "date": "",
    "content": "Europe’s newest rocket, Ariane 6, took flight for the second time from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana at 13:24 local time on 6 March (16:24 GMT, 17:24 CET). This was the first commercial flight for Ariane 6, flight VA263, delivering the CSO-3 satellite to orbit. Arianespace was the operator and launch service provider for the French Procurement agency (DGA) and France’s space agency CNES on behalf of the French Air and Space Force’s Space Command (CDE).\n\nDuring this second launch, all phases were successfully executed, including the Auxiliary Propulsion Unit (APU) reignition, the Vinci engine’s third boost and deorbiting of the upper stage.\n\nJosef Aschbacher, ESA’s Director General said: “The second successful flight of Ariane 6 marks a significant milestone in Europe's journey towards enhanced autonomous access to space. Ariane 6 is a bedrock of this endeavour, paving the way for a promising future for European space activities, alongside Vega-C and new European launchers on the horizon. This achievement would not have been possible without the dedication, collaboration, and hard work of our incredible teams. My heartfelt thanks go out to all colleagues who have made this monumental accomplishment possible. Together, we are elevating the future of Europe - and remember, it all starts with a launch.”\n\n“The first commercial launch of Ariane 6 demonstrates what will become regular with several Ariane 6 launches planned for 2025. The upper stage also showed its full potential, a unique piece of hardware that can ensure all types of missions to orbit while also actively avoid becoming space debris itself, reaffirming Europe’s commitment to minimise in-orbit space debris,” said Toni Tolker-Nielsen, ESA Director of Space Transportation.\n\nAriane 6 is Europe’s heavy launcher and a key element of ESA’s efforts to ensure autonomous access to space for Europe’s citizens. Its modular and versatile design allows it to launch all missions from low-Earth orbit into deep space. For this launch, the rocket was used in its two-booster configuration.\n\nShortly after liftoff and booster separation, the upper stage separated from the core stage. The upper stage engine then fired for the first time, taking Ariane 6 into an elliptical orbit travelling 300 km at its closest to Earth, and 600 km at its farthest from Earth, achieving the ‘chill-down’ and first ignition of the Vinci engine and of the Auxiliary Propulsion Unit. After a ‘coasting’ phase lasting 37 minutes, the engine fired up for a second time.\n\nAfter Vinci’s second boost, the rocket’s passenger, a French satellite called CSO-3, was injected into Sun-Synchronous Orbit at an altitude of around 800 km. Spacecraft separation occurred one hour and six minutes after liftoff.\n\nAfter the successful delivery of CSO-3, Ariane 6 demonstrated the full potential of its upper stage. The Auxiliary Propulsion Unit ignited as expected, and the Vinci engine’s third boost put the upper stage into a reentry orbit to safely burn up through Earth’s atmosphere, preventing accumulation of space debris. This confirms the full capability of Ariane 6.\n\nThank you for liking\n\nYou have already liked this page, you can only like it once!"

    "title": "First CubeSat joins ESA's Ramses mission to asteroid Apophis",
    "date": "",
    "content": "ESA’s first planetary defence mission, Hera, launched in October 2024 on a journey to the binary asteroid system Didymos, where it and its two CubeSat passengers, Milani and Juventas, will study the aftermath of humankind’s first attempt at asteroid deflection.\n\nTo facilitate its rapid development, ESA's Ramses mission will leverage much of the technology developed for Hera.\n\nThe mission’s first CubeSat will be a hybrid that combines the platform and dust analyser of Milani with the low-frequency radar instrument of Juventas.\n\nThe dust analyser will examine the material that could be released from the surface of Apophis by phenomena such as landslides, while the radar instrument will enable a detailed investigation of Apophis’ internal structure.\n\nWhile Apophis poses no danger, these investigations would allow us to practice techniques that humankind could use to determine the structure of a hazardous asteroid and assess how best to knock it off a collision course with Earth.\n\nTyvak International will draw on their experience overseeing the development of Hera’s Milani CubeSat to lead a consortium of companies from a number of ESA Member States. The project has been awarded 4.7 million euros of the funding allocated to Ramses mission preparations in July 2024.\n\n“By utilising existing technologies, this CubeSat will bring onboard the Ramses mission trusted European industrial and research partners that have demonstrated their ability to deliver high-quality mission elements under a tight deadline,” says Fabio Nichele, CEO at Tyvak International.\n\n“Our commitment to undertake and exceed advanced space mission challenges, and flawlessly deliver miniaturised space system technologies, is pushing the boundaries of the European planetary defence to unrivalled excellence. We are thrilled to honour the trust of the Agency in such complex and historical journey.”\n\nMeanwhile, preparations for the main Ramses spacecraft are making good progress and demonstrating the maturity of the overall mission concept prior to the critical funding decision at ESA’s Ministerial Council in November.\n\n“The recent discovery of asteroid 2024 YR4 has highlighted the fact that an asteroid reconnaissance mission could be required at short notice if we were to detect a significant impact hazard,” says Richard Moissl, Head of Planetary Defence at ESA.\n\n“With Ramses, we are not only capitalising on a unique scientific opportunity, we are also demonstrating ESA’s ability to develop an asteroid mission on a strict deadline that realistically reflects the time we may have to respond to a hazard in the future.”\n\nRamses project manager, Paolo Martino, adds: “When Apophis passes Earth in April 2029, it will capture the attention of the entire world.\"\n\n\"With Ramses, we could put Europe in a front row seat: we could be the ones delivering the close-up images of Apophis and leading global efforts to harness this truly historic opportunity for space exploration, asteroid science and planetary defence.”\n\n“Thanks to the hard work of our industrial and institutional partners in Europe and Japan, Ramses continues to pass each milestone on its tight schedule, which would require a launch in 2028 in order to rendezvous with Apophis before it passes Earth.”\n\nRelying on proven technology for the first Ramses CubeSat has enabled the team to explore exciting new possibilities for the second. The Ramses team is currently considering whether the mission’s second CubeSat could instead be a lander that would touch down on Apophis. The lander’s surface instruments could open up a new valuable dimension to the mission’s scientific capabilities.\n\nThank you for liking\n\nYou have already liked this page, you can only like it once!"
