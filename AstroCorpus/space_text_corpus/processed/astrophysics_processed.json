commercial partner save mars sample-return mission , astronaut testing boeing starliner became long-term resident international space station when craft thruster failed behave planned . farther afield , new image milky way supermassive black hole hinted might possess hidden jet , astronomer discovered heaviest galactic stellar-mass black hole , researcher ramped up search atmospheric feature might signal life extrasolar planet . , james webb space telescope made brand-new discovery added old one , continuing prove even one cosmic question answered , many more left wake . james webb space telescope ( jwst ) one most powerful tool search habitable planet warm , temperate atmosphere . finding world never going easy . perhaps no single exoplanet more discussed debated over past year k2-18 b , planet habitable zone red dwarf 124 light-year away . roughly .6 time earth mass .6 time girth , scientist sure whether rocky super-super-earth miniature version hydrogen-rich gas giant like neptune . , researcher using jwst reported k2-18 b atmosphere contained carbon dioxide methane . one interpretation data planet hydrogen-rich atmosphere rocky surface covered global water ocean . even more tantalizing , team reported possible indication dimethyl sulfide ( dm ) , compound earth produced life mainly phytoplankton . signal k2-18 b very tentative , team noted ; even confirmed , could another chemical mimicking spectral signature dm . may , , team led researcher university california , riverside , reported astrophysical journal letter putative dm signal much more likely caused methane . also concluded distinguishing dm methane particular wavelength probably beyond jwst capability . however , found still possible very high level dm could identified mid-infrared ; jwst result k2-18 b wavelength pending.days later , another jwst study published nature , reporting first time strong sign atmosphere around exoplanet definitely rocky . however , planet , 55 canrcri e , hardly

detected distant galaxy ligo-virgo gravitational observatory , said study lead author gaia collaboration member pasquale panuzzo cnrs , observatoire de paris , france , press release . kind discovery make research life . addition breaking weight record , gaia bh3 also shedding light how massive black hole form . aging star blow away much mass through wind , leaving less material create heavy black hole . star born earlier cosmos history more massive may weaker wind , thus leaving behind more massive black hole . backing up story companion : old , metal-poor star , meaning few element heavier hydrogen helium . star essentially metal manufacturer . generation star enriches cosmos , younger generation contain more metal birth . metal-poor star therefore earlier cosmic time . based motion , pair likely belonged globular cluster long since cannibalized milky way . point gaia bh3 relic cosmos ancient past , hiding plain sight . furthermore , discovery also seen preliminary teaser content gaia dr4 , paper concludes , undoubtedly reveal binary system hosting [ black hole ] . car-sized perseverance rover spent four year mars wheeling across ancient lakebed jezero crater , drilling

early . time tell actually pull multi-planet effort . earth moon lightweight . loom large sky , gravity not strong enough hold onto bulky atmosphere . retain thin blanket atom , called exosphere . planetary scientist know exosphere generated through space weathering , interaction between moon surface incoming meteorite solar radiation generate atom replenish . without , exosphere would dissipate atom drifted space . exactly process combination most important remained unknown , researcher mit university chicago used soil collected apollo astronaut determine last year meteorite main culprit . work published aug. 2 science advance . 10 sample , isolated two element potassium rubidium measure isotope soil . isotope given element contain number proton different number neutron nucleus ; isotope more neutron heavier . soil preferentially contained heavier isotope , expected . when meteorite radiation slam lunar surface , vaporizes bit soil . lighter isotope float up create exosphere , heavier isotope fall back ground , different space weathering process leave different amount heavy isotope . comparing ratio isotope potassium rubidium soil held key how released . reason why look ratio instead one isotopic system help remove many complexity isolate effect certain process . rubidium potassium moderately volatile element similar geochemical behavior , meaning tend respond similarly many process , like melting vaporization . when look isotopic ratio , essentially filtering common effect process would affect element similarly , say study lead author nicole nie

last year , eht team released image sgr polarized light , alongside two paper published march 27 astrophysical journal letter . polarization refers orientation electromagnetic wave make up light . when light polarized , wave oscillate together preferred direction . within black hole accretion disk swirling , superheated plasma , magnetic field line align moving particle emit polarized light , essentially stamping emission afterimage embedded magnetic field . , examining polarization reveals picture magnetic field around black hole . polarized light , sgr * appears remarkably similar black hole imaged way : m87 * elliptical galaxy m87 . despite fact sgr * roughly thousand time less massive thousand time smaller , plasma around moving much quicker m87 , hinting strong , ordered magnetic field might more ubiquitous around supermassive black hole previously thought . also hint something else might more widespread astronomer thought : jet . many most massive black hole , including m87 , launch far-reaching jet accretion disk , powered magnetic field . , sgr * magnetic field similar more massive black hole , could host jet like well ? no jet ever seen blasting black hole , search . polarized light image still powerful tool , small tweak model input create big change polarization produced , allowing researcher better understand condition around supermassive black hole . after year anticipation hype , total solar eclipse april , , made good promise , giving ten million viewer chance revel majesty sun corona . eclipse almost certainly most-viewed history u.s. seven year prior , great american eclipse 2017 cut across nation coast coast , 12 million people living path totality . , number 31 million u.s. , path blanketed major metro area texas eastern seaboard . fact ,
