    "date": "Published: March 3, 2025",
    "content": "october , after decade serious effort , astronomer announced first discovery planet orbiting sun-like star . , few planet known exist beyond solar system accompanied pulsar , collapsed remnant burnt-out star , revealed through glitch precise timing pulsar radio emission . strange cinder hardly resembled sun , discovery 1995 finally reassured astronomer solar system indeed relative perhaps even near-twins milky way . however , first exoplanet , five more followed first half , qualified distant cousin . technique revealed could find massive planet , exoplanets mass comparable jupiter s. instead circling star separation comparable jupiter-sun distance , four orbit far smaller mercury , none came close size jupiter s. , using solar system prototype , model how planet form explained small , rocky planet develop close star . likewise , much larger , mostly gaseous planet would form farther where could amass great amount gas away star heat . first discovery prompted theorist spring action . produced model gas giant born far star , migrate inward through gravitational interaction disk material formed planet . first discovery planet beyond sun , notion solar system prototypical wiped away . surprise continued . today , first six exoplanets provide .1 percent entry catalog maintained nasa european space agency . astronomer found great majority planet two different discovery method , handful technique produced additional minority . success verify emphasize overarching result : exoplanets exist large number display amazing variety diameter , mass , density , composition , well size eccentricity orbit . wealth exoplanet rich underscore danger , clear hindsight , using single example phenomenon reach general conclusion . many way , turn , make planetary system . now- , -plus discovery show most common type exoplanet exist solar system . instead , title most abundant belongs class super-earths sub-neptunes , mass between earth neptune s. model planet typically envision solid core various size , surrounded either varying amount hydrogen helium ( similar jovian planet larger core ) large amount water thinner atmosphere . not much more massive earth may consist almost entirely rock metal . astronomer owe increasingly productive provocative flow exoplanet knowledge use ever more sensitive instrument . obtain data telescope earth , others depend spaceborne observatory . latter includes multipurpose facility , hubble space telescope ( hst ) james webb space telescope ( jwst ) , dedicated spacecraft , most notably european space agency corot , operated 2006 ; nasa kepler space telescope , worked 2009 through ; successor , nasa transiting exoplanet survey satellite ( tess ) . star typically outshine planet weak reflected light factor close billion more , astronomer most successful technique detecting exoplanets look star . increasingly precise measurement , search either tiny variation star motion response planet gravitational force , minuscule change star brightness occur when planet pass front . two technique , radial velocity transit method , respectively , revealed 93 percent verified exoplanets . radial velocity refers star motion toward away u along line sight . more century , astronomer examined spectrum star , comparing observed wavelength laboratory value produced known atom molecule rest reveal composition well motion star . improvement instrument technique allow astronomer measure velocity accuracy close meter ( few foot ) per second , slow amble human . observation show repetitive , sinusoidal ( up-and-down ) deviation star radial velocity indicate presence planet , tugging star back forth orbit . radial velocity observation yield surprising wealth information unseen planet . time one tug next related planet orbital period , deviation pure sine wave reveal eccentricity orbit . astronomer know mass star ( analysis spectrum ) , planet orbital period allows calculation size planet orbit , size up-and-down change star radial velocity reveals planet mass . massive planet close star produce biggest , easiest-to-find signal hence , early massive exoplanet discovery . one more parameter emerges type star planet distance : planet surface temperature absence atmosphere . modeler provide many more option how temperature could vary different feasible atmosphere . radial velocity measurement technique even discover multiple planet around given star . multiple system , planet imposes sinusoidal pattern star radial velocity , adding seemingly tangled , superimposed mess . however , astronomer disentangle proper analysis . current record-holder belongs six-planet system , may reasonably expect even larger system emerge approach . , radial velocity variation revealed more thousand exoplanets , making second most successful discovery method . observational program across globe continue search planet method , pushing limit detection find ever more elusive world smaller mass , orbiting farther away star planet like one know solar system . transit method far away most successful way discover exoplanets . transit survey monitor star brightness almost continuously , searching minuscule dip arise planet pass directly front star , recur regularly planet completes orbit . occur planet orbital plane coincides almost exactly line sight . most exoplanet orbit lack fortunate alignment , astronomer know full well even best instrument not find majority exoplanets using transit technique , although smaller orbit increase chance alignment produce transit . almost compensation incompleteness , transit observation provide not exoplanet orbital period also size ( though not mass ) , astronomer know size star , revealed spectral characteristic . restless nature earth atmosphere make spaceborne observatory much better detecting tiny change due transit star brightness . extraterrestrial civilization observed transit sun planet , would note dip 1 percent when jupiter passed front sun , .01 percent when earth made passage ( five time more frequently ) . standard , verification exoplanet existence requires least three transit observation , jupiter-sized planet jupiter-sized orbit would take least 10 year achieve status . exoplanets discovered transit method offer unique additional benefit . comparing high-resolution spectroscopic observation star planet during transit observation star alone , astronomer determine whether exoplanet atmosphere . , even sometimes deduce composition atmosphere contribution total spectrum . like radial velocity result , rhythm transit caused multiple planet system disentangled reveal size orbital period world . astronomer applied technique discover one system seven exoplanets , another eight . planet orbit nearly plane ( would not detect otherwise ) , sun planet . radial velocity method , exoplanet detection transit occur more readily around smaller , less luminous star , whose planet produce larger change velocity brightness . although most system multiple planet found orbit comparatively smaller , low-mass , low-luminosity red dwarf star , appear around star more like sun . one more exoplanet discovery technique deserves attention impressive ability ( failing ) : gravitational lensing . einstein demonstrated , gravitational force bend space , massive object pass almost directly front more distant source light change path light source , typically focusing produce temporary increase brightness . star motion happens carry almost across line sight more distant star , gravitational lensing brighten light farther star few week even month , based typical stellar velocity . called microlensing event , size duration blip stellar brightness increase mass foreground star produce . within blip , sometimes much smaller , briefer blip , lasting perhaps hour , superimposed overall brightness curve . smaller blip , produced planet orbit , reveals planet mass . microlensing event observed even lensing star lie ten thousand light-year away . distance near beyond reach radial velocity transit method , most succeed star hundred few thousand light-year away . microlensing , however , one great drawback : one done . foreground star moved away farther star , no hope exists recurrence situation . ever-growing exoplanet census includes more ,000 member more 800 planetary system found radial velocity observation , more 200 discovered microlensing effect , ,300 revealed transit . many more candidate await confirmation via future observation . more complex subtle method added several dozen additional planet overall list , 82 more planet ( writing ) straightforward highly difficult approach direct imaging . future exoplanet discovery follow dual pathway : detection more planet , especially new instrument , superior analysis exoplanets already list . today , astronomer three primary ( nowhere near ) instrument discover examine planet milky way . one more soon join , fifth , most powerful , go well begin operation 20 year . three instrument currently return biggest stream useful data tess , hst , jwst . next list , nancy grace roman space telescope , scheduled launch date mid- , fifth greatest potential exoplanet discovery habitable world observatory ( hwo ) , still development . astronomer promoting guiding hwo remain highly enthusiastic , commentator often note slow bleed funding nasa most ambitious project cast doubt spacecraft ready launch mid-2040s , currently planned . within next few year , tess more ,200 exoplanet candidate yield least another ,000 confirmed planet , repeated transit observation verify . astronomer combine transit data radial velocity measurement made giant ground-based telescope verify improve accuracy orbital data derived tess observation . many tess newfound world , well discovered planet-finding technique , furnish rich field study jwst , lot observational time mighty telescope reserved exoplanet follow up . astronomer gain even more exoplanet observation when roman join jwst orbit around earth second lagrangian point spot provides orbital stability ,000 mile ( .5 million kilometer ) farther sun earth . like hst , roman mirror .4 meter diameter . unlike hst , though , roman employ two instrument : wide-field camera coronagraph . camera observe cosmos infrared radiation well visible light , secure image detailed hubble , over field view 10 time wider . roman first-of-a-kind visible-light infrared coronagraph use series mask , prism , deformable mirror block direct light star feed remaining light star surroundings high-contrast camera spectrometer . allow coronagraph obtain image spectrum planet little one-hundred-millionth parent star brightness , revealing characterizing exoplanets similar jupiter diameter orbital distance . jupiter-like planet merit , ultimate goal exoplanet hunter naturally center securing image earth-like planet one-tenth jupiter diameter , orbiting star distance would allow liquid water exist surface . achieve goal , astronomer require much larger instrument : hwo , mirror large . -meter mirror jwst . astronomer envision one considerably larger . although spacecraft would investigate solar system object distant galaxy , name reflects primary mission : discover study potentially habitable world . accomplish goal , hwo would employ spectroscopy look biosignatures exoplanet atmosphere , well direct imaging using coronagraph . more ambitious plan hwo call sunshield , whose orbit near hwo would keep positioned block almost light target star . reason proposal blocking starlight more complete before light enters telescope , rather after . sunshield working tandem hwo coronagraph would finally create instrument capable securing image exoplanets whose reflected light , like earth , fall more billion time below star brightness . mit professor sara seager , one leader hunt exoplanets , set chief professional goal find another earth . mean planet size , moving similar orbit around sun-like star . stated number interview , human specie , want find something like [ planet ] , note , demonstrating astronomer experience emotion rest u when
