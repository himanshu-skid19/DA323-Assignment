galaxy type

scientist sometimes categorize galaxy based shape physical feature . classification organize galaxy activity central region powered supersized black hole angle view . milky way one example broad class galaxy defined presence spiral arm . galaxy resemble giant rotating pinwheel pancake-like disk star central bulge tight concentration star . spiral arm wound tightly loosely , not seen earth view galaxy side , edge . spiral galaxy surrounded halo , mixture old star , star cluster , dark matter invisible material not emit reflect light still gravitational pull matter . youngest star form gas-rich arm , older star found throughout disk within bulge halo . milky way andromeda galaxy belong subtype known barred spiral , make up two-thirds group . barred spiral sport ribbon star , gas , dust cut across center . scientist think presence bar indicates galaxy reached full maturity . elliptical galaxy shape range completely round oval . less common spiral galaxy . unlike spiral , elliptical galaxy usually contain little gas dust show very little organization structure . star orbit around core random direction generally older spiral galaxy since little gas needed form new star remains . scientist think elliptical galaxy originate collision merger spiral . lenticular galaxy kind cross between spiral ellipticals . central bulge disk common spiral galaxy no arm . like ellipticals , lenticular galaxy older stellar population little ongoing star formation . scientist few theory how lenticular galaxy evolved . one idea suggests galaxy older spiral whose arm faded . another proposes lenticulars formed merger spiral galaxy . irregular galaxy unusual shape , like toothpick , ring , even little grouping star . range dwarf irregular galaxy 100 million time sun mass large one weighing 10 billion solar mass . astronomer think galaxy odd shape sometimes result interaction others . example , one spiral galaxy passing another stronger gravitational pull could lose material , become distorted , morph new shape . , like gas-rich dwarf galaxy , may new , formed material pulled encounter . perhaps when galaxy collide , create larger , oddly shaped mashup . scientist theorize large irregular galaxy could represent intermediate step between spiral elliptical galaxy . irregular galaxy born galaxy interaction collision typically host mix older younger star , depending characteristic composition original galaxy . irregular galaxy may also hold significant amount gas dust essential ingredient making new star . around 10 % known galaxy active , mean center appear more 100 time brighter combined light star . spiral , elliptical , irregular . milky way not currently active galaxy , although likely experienced burst activity past few million year . astronomer think excess energy come area near galaxy central supermassive black hole , range hundred thousand billion time mass sun . gas dust collect around black hole form accretion disk . black hole gravity compress heat disk , cause material glow across multiple wavelength , infrared x-ray . infrared observation show black hole accretion disk embedded within clumpy ring cooler dust , called torus , may few light-year across . close black hole , small fraction infalling gas driven outward , perpendicular disk , jet particle move near speed light . during early 20th century , astronomer began classifying active galaxy based distinctive characteristic behavior observed . scientist think viewing center galaxy different angle example , seeing directly torus versus seeing side produce many signature trait . active galaxy also categorized brightness radio wavelength . radio-loud galaxy typically emit accretion disk jet . radio-quiet galaxy tend little-to-no emission jet . observed luminosity also thought another aspect viewing angle . jet directed more toward line sight , viewed down barrel , appear brighter more variable viewed wider angle . seyfert galaxy , first identified 1943 american astronomer carl seyfert , most common active galaxy also exhibit lowest energy . seyferts look like normal galaxy visible light , emit considerable infrared radiation . when observed infrared , reveal bright emission donut-shaped torus . also emit x-ray . seyfert galaxy tend lower radio luminosity , although produce radio jet . scientist divide seyferts two class . type seyfert galaxy display unusual feature visible light imply rapid motion near accretion disk . type ii seyferts show feature imply much slower motion . however , distinction may result different viewing angle center galaxy . quasar most luminous type active galaxy . emit light across electromagnetic spectrum , produce powerful particle jet , radiate thousand time energy emitted galaxy like milky way . nearest quasar , called markarian , located 600 million light-year away , see many more quasar farther look . scientist identified over 1 million quasar , farthest one currently known lying 13 billion light-year away . since light take time travel , scientist use light galaxy way peer back time study black hole growth galaxy evolution . merging galaxy young universe may provide fuel power enormous energy output quasar , when feeding frenzy end , black hole not maintain . thought quasar activity may episodic entire phase may last 10 million year . blazars produce light across electromagnetic spectrum . powerful jet point almost directly earth , appear brighter active galaxy . observatory earth sometimes detect high-energy particle like neutrino produced within jet trace back home galaxy . information give scientist glimpse environment around blazar supermassive black hole . universe black hole star exoplanets
