string theory not dead yet

scientist seeking secret universe would like make model show how nature force particle fit together . would nice lego . perhaps better bet would connecting everything string . not literal string , course tiny loop snippet vibrating energy . fit together need mathematical , not via properly shaped piece plastic . decade , many physicist pursued hope equation involving especially tiny string could provide theory solves nature ultimate subatomic mystery . string theory , called , acquired sort fuzzy cultural acclaim , showing up popular tv show like big bang theory ncis . among physicist , reaction theory mixed . after several promising burst discovery 1980s 90 , string fell somewhat favor not delivering promise . among providing proper way include gravity quantum theory subatomic particle . another revealing math would show nature multiple fundamental force different offspring one unified force . still promise unkept . yet during time since string theory retreat limelight , considerable cadre string devotee labored tie loose end together . success remains elusive , real progress made . question plaguing physicist not smallest bit matter also property entire universe may yet yield string theorist effort . many unsolved problem particle physic cosmology deeply intertwined , write physicist fernando marchesano , gary shiu timo weigand 2024 annual review nuclear particle science . string theory may provide path solving problem . one major approach quest figuring whether string theory explain known standard model particle physic . developed last part 20th century , standard model provides sort roster listing nature basic particle . provide building block matter ;

when everything universe changed

million year following big bang , after universe roiling soup particle cooled , cosmos dark boring place . no star make light . no familiar swirl galaxy . certainly no planet . entire universe shrouded neutral hydrogen gas . , perhaps 100 million year , everything started change . over next billion-odd year , universe went bland , unimpressive landscape rich dynamic one . profound shift began when first star lit up . burned , generating heat forging new matter , intense light began tearing apart hydrogen pervaded universe . everywhere electron ripped atom , leaving bulk hydrogen most abundant element universe ionized state remains today . pivotal period when hydrogen went one form another known epoch reionization . began cosmic dawn ushered modern era marvelous texture feature .

last week 245th meeting american astronomical society national harbor , maryland , astronomer presented most recent exciting find james webb space telescope ( jwst ) . one discovery identification most distant so-called core-collapse supernova ever confirmed . explosion mark end life massive star , supernova occurred when universe toddler , .8 billion year old . david coulter , postdoc space telescope science institute ( stsci ) , studied numerous image jwst advanced deep extragalactic survey ( jade ) program , target characterizes earliest galaxy . coulter team captured image up year apart near infrared camera . team uncovered supernova cataloged at2023 ads-v , along more 80 transient ( object vary luminosity over time ) . case at2023 ads-v , image 2022 2023 allowed astronomer compare star behavior over interval . when massive star exhaust fuel nuclear fusion , imbalance force cause star collapse explode outward , categorized type ii supernova . star must least eight time sun mass undergo transformation . case , astronomer estimate mass at2023 ads-v progenitor gargantuan 20 solar mass , real behemoth . at2023 ads-v long-ago environment contained one-third amount heavy element more proton hydrogen helium found today older local universe . heavy element made through fusion core massive star , explode supernova , enriching cosmos . at2023 ads-v one many transient discovered jade . really first sample high-redshift universe look like transient science , said study team member justin pierel , also stsci , press release . trying identify whether distant supernova fundamentally different very much like see nearby universe . certainly yet more early stellar explosion also discovered . no doubt give astronomer fuller picture early day universe , when simplicity beginning give way more complex , richer cosmos filled heavier element , ultimately leading emergence life .
