main type star cluster , hubble imaged over three decade operation . open cluster contain between few dozen few thousand star , formed initial cloud gas dust . density star low enough cluster individual star visible telescope , sometimes unaided eye , giving open appearance . most open cluster reside arm spiral galaxy , star usually relatively young . shape more irregular spherical , large

globular cluster generally appear redder open cluster . large number star relatively small area cause shape globular cluster appear spherical , star intense gravitational attraction pull together . gravitational tie grant globular cluster more stability open cluster , helping keep structure instead breaking up over time . milky way alone over 150 globular cluster , nearest neighboring galaxy andromeda over . embedded cluster precursor open globular cluster . youngest type star cluster , contain newly born forming star surrounded cosmic gas dust . open globular cluster , star formed initial nebula . embedded cluster likely basic unit star formation since significant fraction star form within . star formation end , embedded cluster resemble open cluster , often disrupted passing object due weaker gravitational bond . embedded phase typically last between -7 million year . since embedded cluster heavily obscured dust , rarely observed visible wavelength light . however , hubble infrared instrument detect longer wavelength infrared light easily scattered cloud gas dust . hubble unique capability essential learning more young cluster . much scientist know today stellar science root hubble three decade observation . astronomer use telescope study composition star cluster , how evolve , how gravity influence . hubble also instrumental distinguishing individual star
