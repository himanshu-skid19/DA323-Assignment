cosmology untangle universe most elusive mystery ?

first thing know universe really , really big , say cosmologist michael turner , contemplating reality more four decade . universe big , say , often beyond reach instrument , idea . certainly current understanding cosmic story leaf huge unanswered question , say turner , emeritus professor university chicago visiting faculty member ucla . take question origin . know universe expanding evolving something like .8 billion year , starting when everything existence exploded outward initial state near-infinite temperature density a.k.a . big bang . yet no one know sure big bang , say turner . anyone know triggered , came beforehand whether even meaningful talk time before initial event . fact most distant star galaxy telescope potentially see confined observable universe : region encompasses object galaxy star whose light time reach u since big bang . almost inconceivably vast volume , say turner , extending ten billion light-year every direction . yet no way knowing lie beyond . more , perhaps , stretching infinity . realm utterly strange right down law physic very different . , turner explains 2022 annual review nuclear particle science , mystery expected . scientific study cosmology , field focus origin evolution universe , barely century old . already transformed more new idea , new technology jaw-dropping discovery every reason expect more surprise come . knowable magazine recently spoke turner how transformation occurred cosmology future might . interview edited length clarity . not though nothing happened earlier . people speculating origin evolution universe long know . most done before 100 year ago would call galactic astronomy , study star , planet interstellar gas cloud within milky way . time , fact , lot astronomer argued milky way universe nothing else . two big thing happened 1920s . one work young astronomer named edwin hubble . took interest nebula , fuzzy patch light sky astronomer cataloging hundred year . always debate nature : cloud gas relatively close milky way , island universe big ? nobody able figure . hubble access new -inch telescope , largest world time . gave instrument powerful enough look biggest brightest nebula , show contained individual star , not gas . , also able estimate distance very brightest nebula , constellation andromeda . lay well outside milky way . whole galaxy like . paper alone solved riddle nebula put hubble map great astronomer . today term , identified fundamental architecture universe , consists collection star organized galaxy like milky way 200 billion part universe see . stop . day well , war probably strong word , separation between astronomer took picture astrophysicist used spectroscopy , technique physicist developed 19th century analyze wavelength light emitted distant object . started taking spectrum thing like star planet , comparing emission known chemical element laboratory , could say , oh , not know made , know temperature how fast moving towards away u . could start really studying object . like area science , though , very best people astronomy use tool hand , picture spectrum . hubble case , paid particular attention earlier paper used spectroscopy measure velocity nebula . , striking thing paper nebula moving away u many hundred kilometer per second . spectroscopic term high redshift , meaning emission shifted toward longer wavelength see lab . , when hubble solid distance data two dozen galaxy reasonable estimate more , plotted value redshift data . got striking correlation : away galaxy , faster moving away u . relation known hubble law . took figure meant , though . yes . bit earlier , , albert einstein put forward theory general relativity , complete paradigm shift reformulation gravity . key insight space time not fixed , physicist always assumed , dynamic . matter energy bend space time around , force call gravity result object deflected move around curved space-time . late physicist john archibald wheeler famously said , space tell matter how move , matter tell space how curve . took few year connect einstein theory observation . early mid-1930s , clear hubble discovered not galaxy moving away u empty space , space expanding carrying galaxy along . whole universe expanding . least few scientist 1930s began realize hubble discovery also meant beginning universe . turning point probably george gamow , soviet physicist defected u 1930s . studied general relativity student leningrad , knew einstein equation implied universe expanded singularity mathematical point where time began radius universe zero . call big bang . gamow also knew nuclear physic , helped develop before world war ii . around , collaborator started combine general relativity nuclear physic model universe beginning explain where element periodic table came . key idea universe started hot , cooled expanded way gas aerosol . totally theoretical time . would confirmed 1965 when radio astronomer discovered cosmic microwave background radiation . radiation consists high-energy photon emerged big bang cooled down universe expanded , today 3 degree kelvin above absolute zero also average temperature universe whole . hot , primordial soup called ylem gamow matter would not exist form today . extreme heat would boil atom constituent component neutron , proton electron . gamow dream nuclear reaction cooling soup would produced element , neutron proton combined make nucleus various atom periodic table . idea came up short . took number year village people get calculation right . 1960s , clear would come nuclear reaction mostly hydrogen , plus lot helium 25 percent weight , exactly astronomer observed plus little bit deuterium , helium-3 lithium . heavier element carbon oxygen made later , nuclear reaction star process . early 1970s , creation light element hot big bang , expansion universe microwave background radiation three observational pillar called standard model cosmology , call first paradigm . not wrong current understanding still hot big bang beginning incomplete . 1970s idea hot beginning attracting attention particle physicist , saw big bang way study particle collision energy hope reach accelerator earth . field suddenly got lot bigger , people started asking question suggested standard cosmology missing something . example , why universe smooth ? intensity temperature microwave background radiation , best measure whole universe , almost perfectly uniform every direction . nothing einstein cosmological equation say case . flip side , though why cosmic smoothness almost perfect ? after , most prominent feature universe today galaxy , must formed gravity magnified tiny fluctuation density matter early universe . where fluctuation come ? seeded galaxy ? around time , evidence accumulated neutron proton made smaller bit quark meant neutron-proton soup would eventually boil , , becoming quark soup earliest time . maybe answer lie early quark soup phase , even earlier . possibility led alan guth brilliant paper cosmic inflation . guth idea tiniest fraction second after initial singularity , according new idea particle physic , universe ought undergo burst accelerated expansion . would exponential expansion , far faster standard big bang model . size universe would doubled doubled doubled , enough time take subatomic patch space blow up scale observable universe . explained uniformity universe right away , like balloon blew up size earth bigger : would look smooth . inflation also explained galaxy . quantum world , normal thing like number particle tiny region bounce around . ordinarily , average zero notice . when cosmic inflation produced tremendous expansion , blew up subatomic fluctuation astrophysical scale , provided seed galaxy formation . result poster child connection between particle physic cosmology : biggest thing universe galaxy cluster galaxy originated quantum fluctuation unimaginably small . when detail inflation worked early 1980s , people saw something else missing . exponential expansion would stretched everything space flat certain mathematical sense . according einstein general relativity , way universe could flat mass energy content averaged certain critical density . value really small , equivalent few hydrogen atom per cubic meter . even stretch : astronomer best measurement mean density planet , star gas universe stuff made atom even 10 percent critical density . ( modern figure .9 percent . ) something else not made atom making up difference . something turned two component , one astronomer already begun detect through gravitational effect . fritz zwicky found first clue back 1930s , when looked motion galaxy distant cluster . galactic cluster obviously held together gravity , galaxy close not flying apart . yet velocity zwicky found really high , concluded visible star alone produce nearly enough gravity keep galaxy bound . extra gravity coming form dark matter shine , outweighed visible star large factor . vera rubin kent ford really brought home 1970s study rotation ordinary nearby galaxy , starting andromeda . found rotation rate way fast : nearly enough star interstellar gas hold galaxy together . extra gravity coming something invisible , dark matter . particle physicist loved dark matter idea , unified field theory contained hypothetical particle name like neutralino , axion , would produced huge number during big bang , exactly right property . give light no electric charge very weak interaction ordinary matter . would enough mass produce dark matter gravitational effect . yet detected particle laboratory . know thing . cold , example , meaning move slowly compared speed light . know computer simulation without gravity cold dark matter , tiny density fluctuation ordinary matter emerged big bang would never collapsed galaxy . enough gravity . simulation observation improved , cosmologist began realize even dark matter fraction critical density needed make universe flat . ( modern figure .8 percent . ) missing piece found 1998 when two group astronomer very careful measurement redshift distant galaxy , found cosmic expansion gradually accelerating . something suggested calling dark energy , name stuck pushing universe apart . best understanding dark energy lead repulsive gravity , something built einstein general relativity . crucial feature dark energy elasticity negative pressure . , broken particle more like extremely elastic medium . dark energy remains one great mystery cosmology particle physic , seems mathematically equivalent cosmological constant einstein suggested . modern interpretation , though , corresponds energy nature quantum vacuum . lead extraordinary picture : cosmic expansion speeding up rather slowing , caused repulsive gravity very elastic , mysterious component universe called dark energy . equally extraordinary evidence extraordinary claim built up ever since two team made 1998 discovery awarded nobel prize physic . where : flat , critical-density universe comprising ordinary matter 5 percent , particle dark matter 25 percent dark energy 70 percent . cosmological constant still called lambda , greek letter einstein used . new paradigm referred lambda-cold dark matter model cosmology . yes . amazing , glass-half-full , half-empty situation . lambda-cold dark matter paradigm three pillar well established evidence , allow u describe evolution universe tiny fraction second today . know not done . example , say , wow , cosmic inflation sound really important . why flat universe today explains seed galaxy . tell detail . well , know detail . best understanding inflation caused still unknown field similar higgs boson discovered . say , yeah , dark matter sound really important . gravity responsible formation galaxy cluster universe . ? know . probably kind particle left over big bang , found . finally say , oh , dark energy 70 percent universe . must really important . tell more . say , consistent cosmological constant . really , clue why cosmological constant exist value . cosmology left u three physic question : dark matter , dark energy inflation ? maybe . could everything done 30 year flesh current idea . discover dark matter really particle like axion , dark energy really constant quantum energy empty space , inflation really caused higgs field . more likely not , history guide , missing something surprise horizon . cosmologist trying find surprise following really big question . example : big bang ? happened beforehand ? big bang theory talked earlier anything theory big bang ; theory happened afterwards . remember , actual big bang event , according einstein general relativity , singularity saw creation matter , energy , space time . big mystery , struggle even talk scientific term : phase before singularity ? , like ? , many theorist think , singularity einstein equation represent instant when space time emerged something more fundamental ? another possibility captured attention scientist public alike multiverse . follows inflation , where imagine blowing up small bit space enormous size . could happen more , different place time ? answer yes : could different patch wider multiverse inflating entirely different universe , maybe different law physic one . could biggest idea since copernicus moved u center universe . also very frustrating right , science : universe would completely disconnected , no way access , observe show actually exist . yet another possibility title annual review article : road precision cosmology . used cosmology really difficult instrument quite up task . back 1930s , hubble colleague milton humason struggled year collect redshift few hundred galaxy , part recording one spectrum time photographic plate collected less 1 percent light . astronomer use electronic ccd detector kind everyone carry around phone collect almost 100 percent light . increased telescope size without construction . project like dark energy spectroscopic instrument kitt peak arizona collect spectrum ,000 galaxy 35 million over five year . cosmology used data-poor science hard measure thing within reliable precision . today , precision cosmology , percent-level accuracy . , sometimes able measure thing two different way , see result agree , creating cross-cuts confirm current paradigm reveal crack . prime example expansion rate universe , called hubble parameter most important number cosmology . nothing else , tell u age universe : bigger parameter , younger universe , vice versa . today measure directly velocity distance galaxy few hundred-million light year , few percent level . another way measure satellite observation microwave background radiation , give expansion rate when universe ,000 year old , even greater precision . lambda-cold dark matter model extrapolate expansion rate forward present day see get number redshift . : number differ almost 10 percent ongoing puzzle called hubble tension . maybe loose thread tiny discrepancy precision measurement could lead another paradigm shift . could direct measurement galaxy distance wrong , microwave background number wrong . maybe finding something missing lambda-cold dark matter . would extremely exciting . . /knowable- -1 m. mitchell waldrop freelance journalist based washington , dc . previous story knowable magazine covered topic green nuclear power , green concrete , recycling , future work , ai-generated deepfakes , ranked-choice voting peril cash bail . most recent book cosmic origin : science long quest understand how universe began ( ) . article originally appeared knowable magazine , independent journalistic endeavor annual review . sign up newsletter .
