methane emitted 2022 damaged nord stream gas pipeline more double volume estimated time , according study published nature . leak among biggest ever methane release related human activity occurred when two nord stream pipeline ruptured end september . study put likely methane volume escaped gas pipe under baltic sea range between 000 000 tonne . earlier study put amount much lower , between 000 000 tonne . study coordinated united nation environment programme ( unep ) . researcher used data several satellite including copernicus sentinel-1 copernicus sentinel-2 mission , well infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer ( iasi ) instrument eumetsat metop-b satellite . data esa third-party mission , landsat 8 ghgsat , also used . addition satellite data , study looked source including atmospheric in-situ instrumentation , marine observation , aerial measurement engineering estimate . study compared datasets model pipeline emission rate caused leak . stephen harris , scientist unep international methane emission observatory ( imeo ) , explains , satellite observation one component broader set measurement approach , together enabled study provide comprehensive accurate assessment methane emission event highlighting importance integrating diverse , complementary methane measurement method . research , conducted 70 scientist 30 research organisation , part funded two esa earth observation science society initiative : methanecamp methane+ . according edward malina , esa earth observation atmosphere scientist , study show benefit importance methane concentration provided satellite regular basis . diego fernandez prieto , head esa earth observation science section , noted , sustained esa support scientific advance methane measurement satellite improved ability characterise methane leak globally . believe good example how science transferred climate action better equipped monitor progress respond global methane pledge . study coordinated imeo , also core implementing partner global methane pledge . upper estimate nord stream leak would dwarf world previous largest methane leak . estimated 000 tonne methane released aliso canyon natural gas facility u , between october 2015 february . despite huge volume emitted during one-off event , stephen harris point nord stream release .1 % global human-caused methane emission . explained , equivalent two day oil gas industry annual methane emission . highlight vast number human-caused methane source still require global mitigation effort . international energy agency estimate production use fossil fuel resulted close 120 million tonne methane emission , 10 million tonne came bioenergy . methane emission remained level since reached peak . prior study significant uncertainty regarding impact methane release nord stream leak . study published nature provides first coherent accurate assessment impact . why huge difference estimated size leak study ? initial estimate , according stephen harris , including unep imeo , based data limited number study , many relied incomplete source available time . furthermore , estimate varied widely , capturing part story different perspective . study present first updated estimate incorporates available data account every aspect emission event : methane present pipeline before after rupture , amount dissolved baltic sea , portion ultimately released atmosphere . satellite-based measurement played crucial role understanding latter . thank liking already liked page , like !
