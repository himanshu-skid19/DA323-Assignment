# National Flag Analysis: Key Observations

## Dataset Overview
- Analyzed 195 national flags
- Extracted aspect ratios, colors, and design elements

## Aspect Ratio Findings

- Most common aspect ratio: 2:3 (88 flags, 45.1%)
- Second most common: 1:2 (53 flags, 27.2%)
- Third most common: Other (25 flags, 12.8%)

## Colonial Influence on Aspect Ratios
- Former British colonies predominantly use 2:3 aspect ratio
- Former French colonies predominantly use 2:3 aspect ratio

## Color Analysis
- Most common color: Red (present in 167 flags, 85.6%)
- Average number of colors per flag: 3.6
- Most common dominant color: red (74 flags)

## Regional Color Patterns

- Asia: Red is the most common color (83.3%)
- North America: Red is the most common color (100.0%)
- Africa: Red is the most common color (83.3%)

## Design Elements
- Most common design element: Horizontal bands or stripes (present in 134 flags)
- Flags with horizontal stripes: 134
- Flags with vertical stripes: 126

## Symmetry Analysis
- Flags with high horizontal symmetry: 111
- Flags with high vertical symmetry: 131

## Flag Complexity
- Most complex flag: dm (score: 10)
- Least complex flag: fm (score: 2)

## Correlations
- Strongest correlation: green has a negative correlation (-0.15) with Other aspect ratio

## Comparison with Blog Post Observations
- **Note**: Limited data processing capability affected comprehensive analysis
- **Aspect Ratio Distribution**: Common aspect ratios are 2:3 and 1:2, aligning with typical findings
- **Golden Ratio**: We found 0 flags with aspect ratios approximating the golden ratio
- **Colonial Influence**: Analysis was inconclusive on different aspect ratio preferences between colonial powers
- **Color Count**: Average of 3.6 colors per flag, which aligns with typical findings of 3-4 colors
