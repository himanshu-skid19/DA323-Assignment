dz,Algeria,https://nationalanthems.info/dz.htm,17,"The words to “Qassaman” were written in 1956 in Serkaji-Barberousse Prison in Algiers, where the author Moufdi Zakaria was incarcerated by the French colonial forces. The poem was put into music, first by Mohamed Triki in 1956, then by the Egyptian composer Mohamed Fawzi and became the national anthem upon independence on July 5th, 1962. The anti-French sentiments of the third verse result in this verse occasionally being left out of performances, however the verse remains an official part of the text.

1. We swear by the lightning that destroys,
By the streams of generous blood being shed,
By the bright flags that wave,
Flying proudly on the high djebels,
That we are in revolt, whether to live or to die,
We are determined that Algeria should live,
So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!

2. We are soldiers in revolt for truth
And we have fought for our independence.
When we spoke, nobody listened to us,
So we have taken the noise of gunpowder as our rhythm
And the sound of machine guns as our melody,
We are determined that Algeria should live,
So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!

3. O France, the time of reproof is over
And we have ended it as a book is ended;
O France, this is the day of reckoning
So prepare to receive from us our answer!
In our revolution is the end of empty talk;
We are determined that Algeria should live,
So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!

4. From our heroes we shall make an army come to being,
From our dead we shall build up a glory,
Our spirits shall ascend to immortality
And on our shoulders we shall raise the Standard.
To the nation’s Liberation Front we have sworn an oath,
We are determined that Algeria should live,
So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!

5. The cry of the Fatherland sounds from the battlefields.
Listen to it and answer the call!
Let it be written with the blood of martyrs
And be read to future generations.
Oh, Glory, we have held out our hand to you,
We are determined that Algeria should live,
So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!

ar,Argentina,https://nationalanthems.info/ar.htm,17,"In 1812, Vicente López attended a play about the revolution that brought the country independence two years earlier, the play concluded with an anthem sung by the actors. López was inspired to write a proper anthem for the nation instead of the one presented in the play, and it was approved by the government. The composer of the music used in the play, Blas Parera, was asked to compose the music for the anthem despite Parera’s objections due to the anti-Spanish lyrics and himself being a Spaniard. The stately nature of the music, combined with its long length, make it similar in style to other anthems of the area, a group of anthems I term “Latin American epic anthems”.

The anthem also has had many titles; originally called the “Anthem of May” by López, it was then christened the “Marcha Patriótica” (Patriotic March) by the government on its adoption on May 11, 1813 (the third anniversary of the revolution) and was later known as “Canción Patriótica Nacional” (National Patriotic Song). An 1847 copy titles it “Himno Nacional Argentino”, which is the name it is known by today.

In the following years, the anthem underwent many modifications to tone down the militaristic and anti-Spanish nature of the song. In a presidential decree in 1900, it was declared that the first and last verses of the anthem as adopted on March 11, 1813 (rather than the full original nine verses), would be the official anthem, which remains to this day.

am,Armenia,https://nationalanthems.info/am.htm,19,"The words to “Mer Hayrenik”, taken from a poem by Mikael Nalbandian, were set to music long before Armenia adopted it as her anthem upon regaining her independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The present anthem is a modified version of a poem called “Song of an Italian Girl”, which consisted of six stanzas. Some of the words have also been changed appropriately to reflect the freedom and independence of the country. The anthem melody was found to date from the 19th century in what is now Istanbul, Turkey as a vocal exercise for singers.

In 2006, a search was sent out for a new national anthem, as the criticisms against “Mer Hayrenik” was that it was only meant as a temporary anthem, was not composed by an Armenian, and does not reflect modern Armenia. One of the five proposed candidates is the melody (but not the lyrics) of the anthem of Soviet Armenia.

au,Australia,https://nationalanthems.info/au.htm,5,"A prolific composer, Scottish-born Peter Dodds McCormick was moved to compose a national anthem for Australia when, having attended a concert of the world’s anthems, there was no anthem for Australia. His original lyrics heavily emphasized Australia’s ties to Britain (as Australia was a British colony at the time). Upon Australia’s inauguration as a separate Commonwealth on January 1, 1901, the song was performed, but the British “God Save the Queen” (as the work was then titled) was still the official anthem of Australia. At this time, the third verse of McCormick’s original work was changed.

While “Advance Australia Fair” remained popular with the people in the decades following, no official national anthem other than “God Save the Queen” was declared. In 1974 the Australian Bureau of Statistics conducted a national opinion poll of 60,000 and in 1977 a plebiscite for a national song was conducted. On each occasion, Advance Australia Fair was the preferred option (the other choices were the existing anthem “God Save the Queen” and the popular national songs “Song of Australia” (whose melody was later used for Bougainville‘s anthem) and “Waltzing Matilda”), and it was in consideration of such support that Advance Australia Fair was proclaimed as the national anthem by the Governor-General on 19 April 1984.

In the late 2010s, there was talk in Australia as to how to change the anthem to recognize the indigenous population of Australia in the anthem, at particular concern was the line “for we are young and free”, which implies a young nation from the perspective of the British colonists that have had a presence in Australia since 1788, and not from the perspective of the indigenous people, which have been in Australia for tens of thousands of years. In late 2020, it was proposed to change the phrase to “for we are one and free” and on January 1, 2021, it was officially changed.

From the original five-verse song, only the first and third verses are the official national anthem, with slight changes to make the song more gender-inclusive. The Governor-General of Australia (as the representative of the monarch) is greeted with an abbreviated version of the anthem consisting of the first four bars followed by the last four bars. (The King, as monarch of Australia, continues to use his royal anthem “God Save the King”.)

bs,Bahamas,https://nationalanthems.info/bs.htm,1,"“March On, Bahamaland!” was selected as the winning entry in a national competition, and was adopted on independence July 10, 1973. Since Bahamas retains the British royal family as their head of state, their royal anthem, God Save the King, is used as the royal anthem of the Bahamas as well."
bh,Bahrain,https://nationalanthems.info/bh.htm,14,"Upon independence in 1971, Bahrain adopted the anthem “Bahrainona.” It is in the “Arab fanfare” style of anthem. The original lyrics by Mohamed Sudqi Ayyash were changed in 2002 when the country became a kingdom and the ruler became a king rather than an Emir.

My Bengal of gold, I love you.
Forever your skies, your air set my heart in tune as if it were a flute.
In spring, O mother mine, the fragrance from your mango groves makes me wild with joy,
Ah, what a thrill!
In autumn, O mother mine, in the full blossomed paddy fields I have seen spread all over sweet smiles.
Ah, what beauty, what shades, what an affection, and what tenderness!
What a quilt have you spread at the feet of banyan trees and along the banks of rivers!
O mother mine, words from your lips are like nectar to my ears.
Ah, what a thrill!
If sadness, O mother mine, casts a gloom on your face, my eyes are filled with tears!

by,Belarus,https://nationalanthems.info/by.htm,23,"Upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Belarus kept the anthem it used as a soviet socialist republic since 1955, without the words. (Many SSR’s have used an wordless, or instrumental, version of the SSR hymn very soon after achieving independence.) Replacing the work outright with a new song was considered, and suggestions such as “Магутны Божа!” (“Mahutny Bozha”) [O God Almighty] by Natalla Arsiennieva (which was recommended by the parliamentary education and culture committee in 1995, but was not acted upon) and “Маладая Беларусь” “Maładaja Biełaruś” [Young Belarus] by Janka Kupala (but was never set to music) were put forward, but no change was made.

On July 2, 2002, President Lukashenko set a decree that the Belarus hymn will have lyrics, and ones were adopted in a contest. The lyrics by the contest winner, Uladzimir Karyzna, were similar to the Belarusian SSR anthem lyrics and were based on Klimkovich’s original lyrics for the soviet republic’s anthem.

Protestors against Lukashenko’s government use a variety of songs, including the aforementioned hymn “Mahutny Bozha” and the anthem of the last Belarusian state, “Vajacki mars”.

be,Belgium,https://nationalanthems.info/be.htm,22,"The Belgium anthem had its genesis when Belgium gained its independence in 1830. The popular legend goes that it was written by some young people in a cafe on Fource St. in Brussels in September 1830. While the story may or may not be true, the anthem does date back to that time. In 1860, the anti-Dutch lyrics were softened and the version that is in use today was created. When Deceht (better known as “Jenneval”) wrote his verses, he called the poem ‘La Bruxelloise’. His publisher thought it better to broaden the scope from the city’s to the area’s name (Brabant) and renamed it “La Brabançonne”.

The music was written in September of 1830 and the first public performance of the anthem occurred the following month. Finally, in 1921, it was decreed that only the fourth stanza of the 1860 lyrics are official in the French and Dutch versions, although I understand that all the verses are commonly used and sung. However, an official version of the “Brabançonne” does not actually exist. Different commissions have been established to examine the words and melody of the song and establish an official version. Yet, all of their efforts had been in vain.

There are also anthems of the Flanders and Wallonia areas within Belgium.

Knew how to engage in mighty battles
With strength, courage, ardour, and full of joy, but at the price of blood.
Builders of the present, you too, join forces
Each day for the task stronger in unity.
Build without ceasing for posterity.

Chorus

2. When all around there blows a wind of anger and hate:
Citizen of Benin, be proud, and in a calm spirit
Trusting in the future, behold your flag!
In the green you read hope of spring;
The red signifies the courage of your ancestors;
The yellow foretells the richest treasures.

Chorus

3. Beloved Benin, your sunny mountains, palm trees, and green pastures
Show everywhere your brightness;
Your soil offers everyone the richest fruits.
Benin, from henceforth your sons are united
With one brotherly spirit sharing the hope of seeing you
Enjoy abundance and happiness for ever.

1. Bolivians, a most favorable destiny

Its servile state has now finally ceased.
The martial turmoil of yesterday,
and the horrible clamor of war,
are followed today, in harmonious contrast,
by sweet hymns of peace and unity.
Are followed today, in harmonious contrast,
by sweet hymns of peace and unity.

And, on its altars, once more we must swear:
to die before we would live as slaves.
To die before we would live as slaves.
To die before we would live as slaves.

2. Eternal praise to the brave warriors
whose heroic valor and firmness
conquered the freedom and glories that now
a happy Bolivia justly begins to enjoy!
Let their names, preserved forever in marble and bronze,
transmit their glory to remote future ages.
And in resounding song let them repeat their simple call:
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!
And in resounding song let them repeat their simple call:
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

Chorus

3. Here has Justice erected its Throne
which vile oppression ignores
and, on its glorious stamp let us rejoice
Freedom, freedom, freedom
This innocent and beautiful land,
which owes its name to Bolívar,
is the happy homeland where mankind
enjoys the benefits of good fortune and peace.
Is the happy homeland where mankind
enjoys the benefits of good fortune and peace.

Chorus

4. If a foreigner may, any given day
even attempt to subjugate Bolivia,
let him prepare for a fatal destiny,
which menaces such brave aggressor.
For the sons of the mighty Bolívar
have sworn, thousands upon thousands of times,
to die rather than see the country’s
majestic banner humiliated.
To die rather than see the country’s
majestic banner humiliated.

It was originally without words until the lyrics could be written and agreed upon; the music itself was written under the title “Intermecco”, but the anthem is titled “Državna himna Bosne i Hercegovine” (The National Anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina).

Nearly ten years later, in February, 2009, lyrics written by the composer of the piece, Dušan Šestić, along with Benjamin Isović, were accepted by a parliamentary commission, yet await official adoption by all levels of government, so the anthem still remains officially without words. While the lyrics don’t mention the different ethnicities or the two administrative areas of Bosnia (the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which uses the national anthem, and Srpska, which uses their own anthem), the anthem concludes with “We go into the future, together”.

The anthem doesn’t seem to be all that popular in Bosnia, the various nationalities tending to use their own anthems (Serbia‘s or Srpska‘s by the Bosnian Serbs, Croatia‘s by Bosnian Croats, and the former anthem “Jedna si Jedina” by the Bosnian Muslims.)

Special thanks to: Miguel Tomàs Gómez Hernández for the sheet music and Ozren Arnautovic for some of this information."

br,Brazil,https://nationalanthems.info/br.htm,20,"Brazil’s anthem was first performed in 1831, shortly after Brazil’s first emperor abdicated. During the imperial period (1822-1889) and for the first few years of the republican period thereafter, the anthem was performed without words, no suitable words having been popular with the people. After becoming a republic in 1889, it was often suggested among the republican groups in the country that a new anthem should be adopted, as the current anthem was used during the imperial era. A new anthem was adopted that year, but was not well-recieved by the population, and the anthem of the Empire was declared official on January 20, 1890. The anthem was still without official words, and each state started adopting their own words to the anthem. In 1906, it was brought forward that lyrics for the anthem should be written, and in 1909 a poem by Joaquim Osório Duque Estrada was composed. However it wasn’t until 1922, for the 100th anniversary of independence, that Osório Duque Estrada’s poem was adopted, with several changes to the text.

Brazil, like many other “federalist” nations, have states that have their own anthems as well.

1. The Ypiranga’s placid banks heard
The resounding shouting of a heroic people.
And the sun of freedom, in bright rays,
Shone at this moment in the homeland’s skies.
As the promise of this equality
Was secured by our strong arms,
In your bosom, O Freedom,
We are ready to die.

O beloved, idolized homeland, hail, hail!
Brazil, a vivid dream, a lively ray
Of love and hope settles on the earth,
As in your beautiful sky, smiling and limpid,
The image of the Southern Cross shines resplendent.
A giant by nature, you are beautiful,
Strong, an intrepid colossus,
And your future mirrors this grandeur.

CHORUS:
O land we adore, among a thousand others
You are the beloved one.
You are the gentle mother of the sons of this land,
Beloved homeland, Brazil!

2. Eternally laid in a splendid cradle,
To the sound of the sea and the light from the depths of the sky,
Brazil, you gleam, fleuron of the Americas,
Illuminated by the sun of the New World.
Your smiling, lovely fields have more flowers
Than the most attractive land elsewhere,
Our forests have more life,
Our life in your bosom more love.

O beloved, idolized homeland, hail, hail!
Brazil, may you have as eternal symbol
The starry banner you display,
And may the green laurel of this pennant speak
Of peace in the future and glory in the past.
But if you raise a strong cudgel in the name of justice,
You will see that a son of yours does not run from a fight,
Nor does one who adores you fear death.

English translation
1. Against the humiliating bondage of a thousand years
Rapacity came from afar to subjugate them for a hundred years.
Against the cynical malice in the shape
Of neo-colonialism and its petty local servants.
Many gave in and certain others resisted.
But the frustrations, the successes, the sweat, the blood
Have fortified our courageous people and fertilized its heroic struggle.

CHORUS:
And one single night has drawn together
The history of an entire people,
And one single night has launched its triumphal march.
Towards the horizon of good fortune.
One single night has brought together our people
With all the peoples of the World,
In the acquisition of liberty and progress.
Motherland or death, we shall conquer.

2. Nourished in the lively source of the Revolution,
The volunteers for liberty and peace
With their nocturnal and beneficial energies of the 4 of August
Had not only hand arms, but also and above all
The flame in their hearts lawfully to free
Faso forever from the fetters of those who
Here and there were polluting the sacred soul of independence and sovereignty.

Chorus

3. And seated henceforth in rediscovered dignity,
Love and honour partnered with humanity,
The people of Burkina sing a victory hymn
To the glory of the work of liberation and emancipation.
Down with exploitation of man by man!
Forward for the good of every man
By all men of today and tomorrow, by every man here and always!

Chorus

4. Popular revolution our nourishing sap.
Undying motherhood of progress in the face of man.
Eternal hearth of agreed democracy,
Where at last national identity has the right of freedom.
Where injustice has lost its place forever,
And where from the hands of builders of a glorious world
Everywhere the harvests of patriotic vows ripen and suns of boundless joy shine.

To you, love and honor.

2. Thou art the grave where our fathers sleep,
The garden that our ancestors have cultivated.
We work to make you prosperous
One day we finally arrived.
Africa’s children be faithful
And still progressing in peace
Hoping that your children
Boundless love you forever.

cl,Chile,https://nationalanthems.info/cl.htm,20,"After winning its independence in 1818 in a bloody war against Spain led by Bernardo O’Higgins, a national anthem was commissioned by the new government. Lyrics written by Argentine poet and freedom fighter Bernardo de Vera y Pintado during the war were adopted. In 1819, once the lyrics were written, a melody was sought for the anthem, during this period the words were briefly used to the melody of the Argentine anthem. On August 20, 1820 (although some sources claim it to be in September, 1819) a work (sheet music with Spanish lyrics) by Manuel Robles Guitérrez was first used. At first the anthem proved to be popular but by 1828 had waned in popularity. The government then requested that Ramon Carnicer i Batlle (a Chilean composer of Catalan descent) compose new music for the anthem, using Bernardo de Vera’s text, which is the music still being used today for the anthem.

Once the melody was replaced, it was decided to replace the text as well to remove the anti-Spanish sentiments from the lyrics. In 1847, the young poet Eusebio Lillo wrote a new text to Carnicer’s melody, however he kept the chorus from the original anthem. Today, the chorus and fifth verse of Lillo’s poem make up the official national anthem of Chile.

Following the coup d’etat by Augusto Pinochet in 1973, the military junta dictated that two verses would be used along with the chorus: the fifth verse was retained, and the third verse, which extolled Chile’s army, was then added as the second official verse. It was a common act of protest by detractors to remain silent during the second verse. When democracy was restored in 1990, the government removed the military verse and restored the anthem as it was before the coup; today, supporters of the past military government still sing the third verse.

And your field, embroidered with flowers,

Majestic is the snow-covered mountain
That was given to you by the Lord as a bastion,
That was given to you by the Lord as a bastion,
And the sea that tranquilly washes your shore
Promises future splendour for you,
And the sea that tranquilly washes your shore
Promises future splendour for you.

Sweet fatherland, accept the vows

cn,China,https://nationalanthems.info/cn.htm,19,"China’s anthem, written in 1935, was adopted when the Communists took power in 1949. The anthem was also the theme song of the film, “Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm”. The film tells the story of those who went to the front to fight the Japanese invaders in northeast China in the 1930s, when the fate of the nation was hanging in the balance. The “March of the Volunteers” gave voice to the Chinese people’s determination to sacrifice themselves for national liberation, expressing China’s admirable tradition of courage, resolution and unity in fighting foreign aggression. The anthem is almost never known as “义勇军进行曲” (“Yìyǒngjūn Jìnxíngqǔ”) [the March of the Volunteers]. Most people in China just call it the “中国国歌” (“Zhōngguó guógē”) [Chinese National Song], or, more formally, the “中华人民共和国国歌”(“Zhōnghuá rénmín gònghéguó guógē”) [National Song of the People’s Republic of China].

During the Cultural Revolution (a period of Chinese history roughly from the mid 1960s to the early or mid 1970s, when Mao Zedong was in power), “The March of the Volunteers” was forbidden to be sung (Tian Han, the writer of the lyrics, was also imprisoned), and the song “The East Is Red” (a song that mentions the Communist party and Mao, neither of which are in “The March of the Volunteers”) was the de facto anthem. In 1978, after Mao’s death, “The March of the Volunteers” was restored as the anthem, but with different words, which mention Mao and the Party. The original lyrics were restored in 1982.

co,Colombia,https://nationalanthems.info/co.htm,14,"In 1887, a Bogota comedian named José Domingo Torres, combined his two passions of theatrical music and his love for his country to push for the creation of a national anthem for Colombia. He decided to use as the lyrics of the anthem an inspiration poem written by then President Rafael Núñez commemorating the city of Cartagena, and asked his friend Oreste Sindici, an Italian opera teacher, to compose the music. (One common characteristic of Latin American epic anthems such as Colombia’s is that the music often resembles Italian operas.) The anthem was first performed in November of that year in a music hall in the public school where Sindici taught. The anthem was officially adopted by Congress in 1920, and an official transcription was made in 1946. The anthem is always performed starting with the chorus, then a verse, then the chorus, any one of the eleven verses can be used.

CHORUS:
O unfading glory!
O immortal joy!
In furrows of pain
goodness germinates now
goodness germinates now.
O unfading glory!
O immortal joy!
In furrows of pain
goodness germinates now.

1. The horrible night has ceased,
the sublime liberty
spills the auroras
of its invincible light.
All humanity,
moans within its chains,
understands the words
of He who died on the Cross.

Chorus

2. “Independence!” cries
the American world;
soaked in blood of heroes
the land of Columbus.
Still, one great principle,
“The king is not sovereign”,
resounds, and those who suffer
bless their passion.

Chorus

3. The Orinoco’s bed
fills with the remains,
of blood and tears a river
is there seen flowing.
In Bárbula they don’t know
the souls nor the eyes,
if admiration or horror
feel or suffer.

Chorus

4. On the shores of the Caribbean,
famished, the people fight,
horrors preferring
to treacherous health.
O, aye! for Cartagena
the abnegation is much,
and the shambles of death
its courage despises.

Chorus

5. From Boyacá in the fields,
the genius of glory,
for every ear a hero
undefeated crowned.
Soldiers without breastplate
won victory;
their virile breath
as shield served.

Chorus

6. Bolivar crosses the Andes
that two oceans bathe,
swords as sparks
shine in Junín.
Untameable centaurs
descend to the plains,
and a prescience begins to be felt,
of the epic the end.

Chorus

7. The victorious trumpet
in Ayacucho thunders,
that in every triumph grows
its formidable sound.
In its expansive thrust
Liberty is worn for the first time,
from the American sky
a pavilion forming.

Chorus

8. The virgin her hairs
pulls out in agony
and from her beloved widowed
hangs them on a cypress.
Regretting her hope
covered by a cold headstone,
but glorious pride
hallows her fair skin.

Chorus

9. Thus the motherland is formed,
Thermopylaes are breaking forth;
constellation of cyclops
its night brightened.
The trembling flower
finding the wind mortal,
underneath the laurels
safety sought.

Chorus

10. But it’s not complete glory
to defeat in battle,
that the arm that fights
is encouraged by truth.
Independence alone
The great clamour doesn’t silence;
if the sun illuminates everyone,
justice is liberty.

Chorus

11. From men the rights
Nariño’s preaching,
the soul of struggle
prophetically taught.
Ricaurte in San Mateo,
in atoms flying,
“Duty before life,”
with flames he wrote.

Chorus

its courage despises.

Chorus

5. From Boyacá in the fields,
the genius of glory,
for every ear a hero
undefeated crowned.
Soldiers without breastplate
won victory;
their virile breath
as shield served.

Chorus

6. Bolivar crosses the Andes
that two oceans bathe,
swords as sparks
shine in Junín.
Untameable centaurs
descend to the plains,
and a prescience begins to be felt,
of the epic the end.

Chorus

7. The victorious trumpet
in Ayacucho thunders,
that in every triumph grows
its formidable sound.
In its expansive thrust
Liberty is worn for the first time,
from the American sky
a pavilion forming.

Chorus

8. The virgin her hairs
pulls out in agony
and from her beloved widowed
hangs them on a cypress.
Regretting her hope
covered by a cold headstone,
but glorious pride
hallows her fair skin.

Chorus

9. Thus the motherland is formed,
Thermopylaes are breaking forth;
constellation of cyclops
its night brightened.
The trembling flower
finding the wind mortal,
underneath the laurels
safety sought.

Chorus

10. But it’s not complete glory
to defeat in battle,
that the arm that fights
is encouraged by truth.
Independence alone
The great clamour doesn’t silence;
if the sun illuminates everyone,
justice is liberty.

Chorus

11. From men the rights
Nariño’s preaching,
the soul of struggle
prophetically taught.
Ricaurte in San Mateo,
in atoms flying,
“Duty before life,”
with flames he wrote.

Chorus

km,Comoros,https://nationalanthems.info/km.htm,14,"Having achieved independence in 1975, Comoros’ current anthem was adopted in 1978 after a change in power due to a coup. Both the current and former anthems mention the four islands in the Comoros, however, only three are internationally recognized as part of the Comoros, France still retains control over Mayotte (known as Maori (or Maoré) in the anthem).

Announcing complete independence;
The nation rises up
Because of the faith we have
In this our Comoria.
Let us always have devotion
To love our Great Islands.

We Comorians are of one blood,
We Comorians are of one faith.
On these Islands we were born,
These Islands brought us up.
May God always help us;
Let us always have the firm resolve
To love our fatherland,
Love our religion and the world.

The flag is flying.

The Nation rises up;
Our Islands are lined up.

Noble homeland, your beautiful flag
Express for us your life:
Under the limpid blue of your skies,
Peace reigns, white and pure.

In the tenacious battle of fruitful toil,
That brings a glow to men’s faces,
Your sons, simple farm hands,
Gained eternal renown, esteem and honour
Gained eternal renown, esteem and honour.

Hail gentle country, hail loving mother!
If anyone should attempt to besmirch your glory,
You will see your people, valiant and virile,
Exchange their rustic tools for weapons.

Hail O homeland! Your prodigal soil
Gives us sweet sustenance and shelter.
Under the limpid blue of your sky,
May peaceful labour ever continue.

hr,Croatia,https://nationalanthems.info/hr.htm,16,"The lyrics to the anthem were first printed in Danica (The Morning Star) magazine in 1835, under the title “Hrvatska domovina” (“Croatian Homeland”). The music was composed later (1840s) by Josip Runjanin, a Croatian Serb, on the basis of Donizetti’s “O sole piu ratto” from the opera “Lucia di Lammermoor”. Later, in 1861, the score went through some minor changes done by V. Lichtenegger. In 1891 the song was first sung as the unofficial national anthem at an exhibition held by the Croatian-Slavonian Economic Society in Zagreb. (Croatia, still being part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, had that nation’s anthem as its official one.) It remained unofficial until February 29, 1972, when the first amendment to the Croatian Constitution declared it official (despite being part of Yugoslavia at the time) with a slight change in the lyrics upon 1990 independence.

cy,Cyprus,https://nationalanthems.info/cy.htm,4,"Cyprus is a bi-national community of Greeks and Turks, where Greeks are the majority and the ruling government. When Cyprus was declared independent from Great Britian in 1960, other national symbols such as the flag were enshrined in the new nation’s constitution, but there was no mention of an anthem. Much debates ensued, and neither community could agree on a national anthem; during foreign state visits, different instrumental marches were used. On November 16, 1966, it was unilaterally decided by the Greek members of government (the Turkish members had already boycotted the government by this point) that the Greek anthem would be used by Cyprus as well. (The Turkish community does not recognize this and instead uses the Turkish anthem for their self-proclaimed nation.)

In 2004, as a requirement of joining the European Union, a peace plan was proposed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, which included different national symbols, to make them more inclusive of both communities. This also included a wordless anthem that was agreed to by both Turkish and Greek members of the national symbols committee. However, the plan was rejected by the voters and the Greek “Ode to Freedom” remains the Cypriot national anthem.

do,Dominican Republic,https://nationalanthems.info/do.htm,17,"José Reyés was inspired to make this anthem after noticing a published copy of the Argentine anthem. Reyés believed that his country should also have an anthem, so he invited his friend Emilio Prud’homme to write the lines while he composed the music. Soon after Reyés managed to get his anthem published as well; the first performance was on August 17, 1883, it was well-received by the public and soon grew in popularity.

A motion in the National Congress was made on June 7, 1897 by deputy Rafael Garcia Martinez to give the song official status, but the president refused to sign the bill into law, possibly because of Prud’homme’s disagreement with President Heureaux’s dictatorial government. It wasn’t until 1934, many years after Heureaux’s death, that President Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina officially adopted the song as the national anthem.

The anthem never refers to the nation or its people by the name “Dominican”, but rather uses the poetic term “Quisqueyano” throughout. “Quisqueyano” is a reference to the original native inhabitants’ word for Hispaniola.

This is actually the third anthem used in the Dominican Republic. The first, used from 1844 independence to 1885, was known as “Canción Dominicana”, and the second, used after that, did not appear to have a title.

It wasn’t until 1934, many years after Heureaux’s death, that President Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina officially adopted the song as the national anthem.
The anthem never refers to the nation or its people by the name “Dominican”, but rather uses the poetic term “Quisqueyano” throughout. “Quisqueyano” is a reference to the original native inhabitants’ word for Hispaniola.
This is actually the third anthem used in the Dominican Republic. The first, used from 1844 independence to 1885, was known as “Canción Dominicana”, and the second, used after that, did not appear to have a title.

Spanish lyrics


























































English translation
1. Valients of Quisqueya,
Let us sing with strong feeling
And let us show to the world
Our invincible, glorious banner.

Hail, O people who, strong and intrepid,
Launched into war and went to death!
Under a warlike menace of death,
You broke your chains of slavery.

2. No country deserves to be free
If it is an indolent and servile slave,
If the call does not grow loud within it,
Tempered by a virile heroism.

But the brave and indomitable Quisqueya
Will always hold its head high,
For if it were a thousand times enslaved,
It would a thousand times regain liberty.

3. If it will be exposed to ruse and deceit
Unto contempt of a real imposer,
On to Las Carreras! Beler! …it were places
Where the traces of glory are found.

Where on the top of the heroic bastion,
The word of the libarated became flesh,
Where the genius of Sánchez and Duarte
Taught to be free or to die.

4. And if an unattended leader the splendor
Of these glorious events could ignore,
One has seen in Capotillo in the war
The flag of fire wave.

And the fire that lets the proud lion
Of Castilla become stupefied,
Removes him from the glorious beaches
Where the crossed banner waves.

5. Compatriots, let us proudly
Show our face, from today prouder than ever;
Quisqueya may be destroyed
But a slave again, never!

It is a sanctuary of love that every character
Of the fatherland feels alive!
And it is his coat of arms, the right;
And it is his device: be free or die.

6. Liberty that still rises cool-bloodedly
The victory in her triumphal car.
And the clarion of war re-echoes
Proclaiming his immortal glory.

Liberty! That the echo’s touch
While they’re full of noble tension
Our fields of glory repeat
Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!

And we see your radiant face shining
More brightly than the sun.

2. The worthy sons of the soil
Which Pichincha on high is adorning,
Always acclaimed you as sovereign lady
And shed their blood for you.
God observed and accepted the sacrifice,
And that blood was the prolific seed
Of other heroes whom the world in astonishment saw
Arising in thousands around you.

Chorus

3. For these steel armed heroes
Nothing in the land was invincible
And from the valley to the high Sierra
Could the clamour of the struggle be heard;
After the struggle, victory came flying.
And freedom followed on victory’s heel.
And the toppled lion could be heard,
As it roared in impotence and vanity.

eg,Egypt,https://nationalanthems.info/eg.htm,19,"After the 1979 signing of the peace accord with Israel, Egypt adopted a new, more peace-oriented national anthem.The music was composed by Sayed Darwish, a pioneer of Arabic music and a leader of the modern Egyptian renaissance at the turn of the 20th century. He also maintained close ties with early leaders of the national movement for independence in the Middle East, such as Mustapha Kamel. In fact, the words of the chorus were derived from one of Kamel’s most famous speeches. The music was popular in Egypt, especially after the establishment of the republic, and was long considered an unofficial national anthem until it was officially decreed as such.

The anthem officially consists of three verses, but only the first verse is commonly sung, being both preceded and followed by the chorus.

The anthem was composed by an Italian composer that arrived in the country at the end of the 18th Century as the Director of an opera company and written by General Juan José Cañas, a poet and distinguished military officer, around the year 1856. It was composed at the recommendation of the president Dr. Rafael Zaldívar and was sung for the first time on September 15, 1879 at the National Palace by children and young students from government and private schools of the capital city, and the anthem was very well recieved after the initial performance.

Let us salute the motherland,
Proud to be called her children.
To her well-being let us swear
Boldly and unceasingly to devote our lives.
Let us salute the motherland,
Proud to be called her children.
To her well-being let us swear
Boldly and unceasingly to devote our lives,
our lives,
our lives,
our lives,

1. Of peace enjoyed in perfect happiness,
El Salvador has always nobly dreamed.
To achieve this has been her eternal proposition,
To keep it, her greatest glory.
With inviolable faith, she eagerly follows
The way of progress
In order to fulfil her high destiny
And achieve a happy future.
A stern barrier protects her
Against the clash of vile disloyalty,
Ever since the day when her lofty banner,
In letters of blood, wrote “Freedom”,
Wrote “Freedom”, wrote “Freedom”.

Chorus

2. Freedom is her dogma and her guide;
A thousand times she has defended it,
And as many times has she repelled
The hateful power of atrocious tyranny.
Her history has been bloody and sad,
Yet at the same time sublime and brilliant,
A source of legitimate glory
And a great lesson in Spartan pride.
Her innate bravery shall not waver:
In every man there is an immortal hero
Who knows how to maintain the level
Of the proverbial valour of old.
Valour of old, valour of old.

Chorus

3. All are self-denying and faithful
To the tradition of warlike ardour
With which they have always reaped fame
By saving the motherland’s honour.
To respect the rights of others
And base her actions on right and justice
Is for her, without infamous intrigue,
The constant and most firm ambition.
And in following this line she persists,
Dedicating her tenacious efforts
In giving hard battle for battle;
Her happiness is found in peace,
Is found in peace, is found in peace.

During the Soviet occupation period, it was illegal to sing “Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm”, however Estonians near enough to Finland to listen to broadcasts from that country were able to listen to the melody of the anthem that way, and thus the anthem stayed in the public consciousness.

There has been discussion about replacing the anthem with an original Estonian work, but generally the two nations have been content to share a melody.

fi,Finland,https://nationalanthems.info/fi.htm,22,"The anthem lyrics were taken from a poem by Johan Ludvig Runeberg, a Swedish-speaking poet, called “Vårt land” (Our Land). The song was first sung in 1848 by a student group and became popular in Scandinavia and many of his patriotic poems, including Vårt land were used by promoters of Finnish nationalism. The poem was translated into Finnish some decades later, after Vårt land was well established as a national song, by Paavo Eemil Kajander and became the anthem before 1917 independence.

Estonia‘s anthem, adopted 20 years later, has the same melody, however the last few lines do not repeat as they do normally in the Finnish anthem.

Interestingly, the anthem has never been officially legislated as the Finnish anthem, but rather is traditionally used as the anthem. As such, there is no standard way to perform the 11-verse anthem, but usually the first and the last verses (as presented here) are sung.

There sometimes arises a debate in Finland to change the anthem to Jean Sibelius’ song “Finlandia” (the melody was used in Biafra), a song recognized internationally as a symbol of Finland, but the general opinion seems to be for now to keep the current anthem. (One reason may be that Finlandia is harder to sing compared to Maamme.)

fr,France,https://nationalanthems.info/fr.htm,23,"“La Marseillaise” was written and composed by Claude-Joseph Rouget de Lisle, captain in the Engineering corps garrisoned in Strasbourg during the night of 24 to 25 April 1792 at the behest of the city’s mayor, Baron de Dietrich. The song, originally entitled Hymne de Guerre Dédié au Maréchal de Luckner, became known as Chant de Guerre pour l’Armée du Rhin when it was adopted as the marching song of the National Guard of Marseille. The Marseille troops were singing it as they entered Paris on 30 July 1792, and the Parisians dubbed it the Marseillaise. The anthem is probably the first example of the “European march” style of anthem.

During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, “La Marseillaise” was also known as the anthem of the international revolutionary movement. In 1871, it was the anthem of the Paris Commune, and many later anarchists took inspiration from the Commune. After the fall of the Czarist government in Russia, when Communism was just starting to be set up, the melody of “La Marseillaise” was used (with different words) by radical socialists during the era of the Provisional Government, until “The Internationale” gained more popularity, and started to replace “La Marseillaise” as the anthem of leftist revolutionaries.

Under the First Republic, “La Marseillaise” was one of the civic songs that contributed to the success of the Revolution, and thus was given official status (along with “Chœur de la Liberté”, with words by Voltaire). However, it has not been continuously used since the Revolution; both Empires, the Restoration and the Second Republic passed over it in favour of other songs, with links above. During these times, however, “La Marseillaise” still remained quite popular with the people, especially the republicans, these other anthems were created in an attempt to quell the popularity of “La Marseillaise” (especially during the times of the restored monarchy and empire, when a republican government was against the aims of the current governmental type.)

Not until the Third Republic was the Marseillaise restored to its rank of national anthem on all occasions at which military bands were called upon to play an official air. After the fall of the Third Republic and the occupation of northern France by Germany, the Marseillaise remained the official anthem of both the Vichy government (the Nazi puppet state set up in unoccupied southern France) and the Free France forces, who were against the Vichy government and sought its removal. Both factions also had unofficial anthems in popular use as well, the Vichy government used a song dating from 1847 entitled “Maréchal, nous voilà!” (written and composed by André Montagard and co-composer Charles Courtious), and the Free French “Le Chant des Partisans” composed by Anna Marly (music) and French words by Maurice Druon and Joseph Kessel, customarily sung as the anthem. The Marseillaise was made the official national anthem by the constitutions of the Fourth and Fifth Republics (Article 2 of the Constitution of 4 October 1958). In 1974, President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing had it modified in accordance with earlier scores and slowed the tempo. Since 1981 however, the anthem has once again been performed according to the scores and tempo in use until 1974. While there are seven verses of the song, only the first (and sometimes the sixth and seventh) are sung, along with the chorus.

The lyrics, speaking of bloody battles and a call for citizens to take up arms, have been debated endlessly whether to alter the words to suit the more peaceful times that France currently enjoys, but the original words, capturing the spirit of the French revolution, remain. This is probably due to the fact that “La Marseillaise” is now inexorably linked to France in the mind of the world.

The anthem has become one of the most recognized in the world. Tchaikovsky used a piece of it in his “1812 Overture”, which was a chronicle of the war between Russia and France of that year. (The Russian “God Save the Czar” was also used in his work, but, interestingly, neither anthem was used as the national anthem in 1812! They were, however, both used as the respective countries’ national anthems in 1882, which was when the piece was written.) Also, until the adoption of “The Internationale” in Russia around 1918 as the Russian (later Soviet) national anthem, “La Marseillaise” was used by many communist, socialist, and left-leaning groups as an anthem.

The day of glory has arrived
Against us tyranny’s
Bloody standard is raised
The bloody standard is raised
Listen to the sound in the fields
The howling of these fearsome soldiers
They are coming into our midst
To cut the throats of your sons and consorts

CHORUS:
To arms citizens
Form you battalions
March, march
Let impure blood
Water our furrows

2. What do they want this horde of slaves
Of traitors and conspiratorial kings?
For whom these vile chains
These long-prepared irons?
These long-prepared irons?
Frenchmen, for us, ah! What outrage
What methods must be taken?
It is we they dare plan
To return to the old slavery!

Chorus

3. What! These foreign cohorts!
They would make laws in our courts!
What! These mercenary phalanxes
Would cut down our warrior sons
Cut down our warrior sons
Good Lord! By chained hands
Our brow would yield under the yoke
The vile despots would have themselves be
The masters of destiny

Chorus

4. Tremble, tyrants and traitors
The shame of all good men
Tremble! Your parricidal schemes
Will receive their just reward
Will receive their just reward
Against you we are all soldiers
If they fall, our young heros
France will bear new ones
Ready to join the fight against you

Chorus

5. Frenchmen, as magnanimous warriors
Bear or hold back your blows
Spare these sad victims
Who with regret are taking up arms against us
With regret are taking up arms against us
But not these bloody despots
These accomplices of Bouillé
All these tigers who pitilessly
Are ripping open their mothers’ breasts

Chorus

6. Sacred Love for the Fatherland
Lead and support our avenging arms
Liberty, cherished liberty
Join the struggle with your defenders
Join the struggle with your defenders
Under our flags, let victory
Hasten to you virile force
So that in death your enemies
See your triumph and our glory!

Chorus

7. We shall enter into the pit
When our elders will no longer be there
There we shall find their ashes
And the mark of their virtues
And the mark of their virtues
We are much less jealous of surviving them
Than of sharing their coffins
We shall have the sublime pride
Of avenging or joining them

Form you battalions
March, march
Let impure blood
Water our furrows

2. What do they want this horde of slaves
Of traitors and conspiratorial kings?
For whom these vile chains
These long-prepared irons?
These long-prepared irons?
Frenchmen, for us, ah! What outrage
What methods must be taken?
It is we they dare plan
To return to the old slavery!

Chorus

3. What! These foreign cohorts!
They would make laws in our courts!
What! These mercenary phalanxes
Would cut down our warrior sons
Cut down our warrior sons
Good Lord! By chained hands
Our brow would yield under the yoke
The vile despots would have themselves be
The masters of destiny

Chorus

4. Tremble, tyrants and traitors
The shame of all good men
Tremble! Your parricidal schemes
Will receive their just reward
Will receive their just reward
Against you we are all soldiers
If they fall, our young heros
France will bear new ones
Ready to join the fight against you

Chorus

5. Frenchmen, as magnanimous warriors
Bear or hold back your blows
Spare these sad victims
Who with regret are taking up arms against us
With regret are taking up arms against us
But not these bloody despots
These accomplices of Bouillé
All these tigers who pitilessly
Are ripping open their mothers’ breasts

Chorus

6. Sacred Love for the Fatherland
Lead and support our avenging arms
Liberty, cherished liberty
Join the struggle with your defenders
Join the struggle with your defenders
Under our flags, let victory
Hasten to you virile force
So that in death your enemies
See your triumph and our glory!

Chorus

7. We shall enter into the pit
When our elders will no longer be there
There we shall find their ashes
And the mark of their virtues
And the mark of their virtues
We are much less jealous of surviving them
Than of sharing their coffins
We shall have the sublime pride
Of avenging or joining them

CHORUS:
United in concord and brotherhood,
Awake, Gabon, dawn is at hand.
Stir up the spirit that thrills and inspires us!
At last we rise up to attain happiness.
At last we rise up to attain happiness.

1. Dazzling and proud, the sublime day dawns,
Dispelling for ever injustice and shame.
May it still advance and calm our fears,
May it promote virtue and banish warfare.

Chorus

2. Yes, may the happy days of which our ancestors dreamed
Come for us at last, rejoicing our hearts,
And banish the sorcerers, those perfidious deceivers
Who sowed poison and spread fear.

Chorus

3. So that, in the eyes of the world and of friendly nations,
The immortal Gabon may maintain her good repute,
Let us forget our quarrels, let us build together
The new structure of which we all have dreamed.

Let us remain vigilant, without weakness and without hatred!

gm,Gambia,https://nationalanthems.info/gm.htm,1,"“For The Gambia Our Homeland” is the official anthem of this English speaking nation in the heart of French-speaking West Africa. Adopted upon 1965 independence, the music, from the traditional Mandinka song “Foday Kaba Dumbuya”, was adapted by the husband of the lyricist, Jeremy Frederic Howe."
gh,Ghana,https://nationalanthems.info/gh.htm,2,"The original words to this anthem, adopted upon independence in 1957 and written by the composer Philip Gbeho, were changed upon the declaration of a republic in 1960, and when the government was overthrown six years later, the current lyrics were adopted after a contest was held for new lyrics.

Special thanks to: Reinhard Popp for the former lyrics."
gr,Greece,https://nationalanthems.info/gr.htm,3,"The Greek Anthem is based on the “Hymn to the Freedom”, a large 158 verse poem written by Dionysios Solomos, a distinguished poet from Zakynthos Island. It was inspired by the Greek Revolution of 1821 against the Ottoman Empire. During 1828 Nikolaos Mantzaros composed the music for Solomos’ hymn, one version for the entire poem, and one for just the first two stanzas. Although King Othon (Otto) decorated both of them for their work (1845 and 1849), he did not replace the Royal Anthem of that time with the Solomos/Mantzaros hymn. The royal anthem then in use was a musical derivative from the German one, with a text glorifying Othon and his dynasty. After the overthrow of the dynasty, the new King George I and the Greek establishment decided to look for a clearly Greek work, both with respect to the poetry and the music. The “Hymn to the Freedom” was readily there – extremely popular since the Revolution times, often recited or sung during patriotic meetings and celebrations, and the “Hymn to Freedom” (with Mantzaro’s version for the first two stanzas only) became the national anthem.

The Greek anthem is also used in Cyprus, which has a substantial Greek community.

Special thanks to: Theo Stylianides for the sheet music."
gd,Grenada,https://nationalanthems.info/gd.htm,2,"Before independence, from 1967-1974, Grenada was an associate state of the United Kingdom. Like other associated British states in the West Indies Grenada had its own anthem but unlike the other states, which by and large adopted these anthems as their national anthem upon full independence, Grenada’s “National State Anthem” (with music by Rolstan Percival Jawahir Adams and lyrics by Dr. John George Fletcher) was not used when independence was granted, instead adopting “Hail Grenada” upon independence in 1974. The words of the national motto, “Ever Conscious of God We Aspire, Build and Advance as One People”, appear in the lyrics. Grenada also still retains the British monarch as their head of state, and thus has the British anthem as their royal anthem.

Special thanks to: Jo Hyo-roe for the sheet music and Keith Terrett for the music file."
gt,Guatemala,https://nationalanthems.info/gt.htm,20,"Written in response to an 1887 contest calling for a national anthem to be adopted, the winning entry was not proclaimed until 1896, the first ever performance of the anthem took place during a lyric-literary meeting taking place at the Colon Theater, the night of Sunday 14 March 1897, as one of the main events of the Central American Exposition, and the author of the music was decorated with a gold medal and honor diploma. (Ovalle had been known previously for setting to music “Himno Popular” (The People’s Anthem) by the poet Ramón P. Molina. It is unclear whether the music used for Ovalle’s work was the same as the music that was submitted for the national anthem competition.) The author of the lyrics, however, was submitted anonymously, it was not until 1911, when it was discovered that the author was the Cuban poet Jose Joaquin Palma, who on his deathbed was honored with a silver wreath placed on his head, while outside the public and the bands sang the Himno Nacional.

The original lyrics were modified slightly in 1934 by Professor Jose Maria Bonilla Ruano, a Spanish grammar scholar. Some verses were softened in their bloody context while others were enhanced in their poetic beauty.

The anthem has four verses (including four separate choruses at the end of each verse). Unlike many other nations with multi-verse anthems, all four verses are official and sung in Guatemala. The anthem is sometimes erroneously called “¡Guatemala Feliz!” (Guatemala, Be Praised) from the opening words of the anthem, but officially there is no title and is simply referred to inside the country as “Himno Nacional”.

1. Fortunate Guatemala! May your altars
Never be profaned by cruel men.
May there never be slaves who submit to their yoke,
Or tyrants who deride you.
If tomorrow your sacred soil
Should be threatened by foreign invasion,
Your fair flag, flying freely in the wind,
Will call to you: Conquer or die.

CHORUS:
Your fair flag, flying freely in the wind,
Will call to you: Conquer or die;
For your people, with heart and soul,
Would prefer death to slavery.

2. From your old and hard chains
You forged, with an ire-driven hand,
The plow that fertilizes the soil
And the sword that saves honor.

Our fathers fought one day,
Lit up in patriotic burning
And they were able, without bloody clash,
To place you on a throne of love.

CHORUS:
And they were able, without bloody clash,
To place you on a throne of love,
That our Nation, in energetic assent,
Gave life to the ideal redeemer.

3. Your emblem shows a piece of the sky
In which a cloud gets its whiteness
Wretched is he who dares in madness
stain your colors

Well, your brave and proud sons
who admire the peace within
will never avoid the rough battles
if they are to defend their land and their home.

CHORUS:
They will never avoid the rough battles
if they are to defend their land and their home
that honor is the idea that reigns their souls
and the altar of the mother country their altar

4. Lying in the magnificent Andes
with two oceans at hearing distance
under the wing of seeds and gold
you become entranced from the beautiful quetzal

Native bird that lives in your seal
protector that protects your soil
hopefully he will fly high
more than the condor and the royal eagle!

CHORUS:
Hopefully he will fly high
more than the condor and the royal eagle
and in his wings, raise up to the sky:
Guatemala, your immortal name!

gw,Guinea-Bissau,https://nationalanthems.info/gw.htm,13,"In 1963, a delegation from Portugese Guinea (as it was then known, as a Portugese colony) visited China. After hearing a song composed by Xiao He, one of the independentist politicians in attendance, Amilcar Lopes Cabral, said that he would like that composer to compose a similar song to inspire the people of Portugese Guinea to strive for independence. Using African music as his inspiration, Xiao He composed the music, which became the anthem of Guinea-Bissau upon 1974 independence.

Since Cabral’s organization included both Portugese Guinea and Cabo Verde, the anthem was also adopted by Cabo Verde when their independence was achieved a year later. The two nations even proposed to merge, but this merger dissolved before it was realized, and a few decades later, Cabo Verde subsequently adopted its own anthem.

hn,Honduras,https://nationalanthems.info/hn.htm,16,"Before the current anthem was adopted in 1915, other patriotic songs were unofficially used in Honduras. The current anthem is like many others in Latin America in that the music has an operatic, “epic” feel to it (the composer was born in Germany), and has many verses (in this case, seven), which schoolchildren are expected to memorize in its entirety as a way of learning the country’s history, even though the chorus and the last verse are usually only used on official occasions. As such, it can be classified as a “Latin American epic anthem”.

A unique aspect of the Honduran anthem, however, is that it chronicles the history of the country in its seven verses. The first verse describes the country as Christopher Columbus, the first European to land in Honduras, would have seen it. The second tells of how men “from a country where the sun rises” dreamt of Honduras and go out to seek it. Upon arrival, they find that a flag (Spain’s) has been placed there. The third verse chronicles the native population’s attempted resistance against the Spanish. The fourth speaks of the three centuries under Spanish rule, and how requests for change from the colonies, like Honduras, were unheeded; until one day when news of revolution in Europe reached the Americas. Verse 5 continues this thought, stating how the French revolution was a model for those in Honduras seeking redress from Spain. The next verse (verse six) chronicles the revolutions that occurred in the Spanish colonies in America, as one by one they gained liberation from Spain, including Honduras (as part of the Central American federation, at first.) The final verse is a cry to all Hondurans to defend the nation, even in death if necessary.

The chorus, sung after each verse and at the start of the anthem (if all verses are sung), or at the start and end of the anthem, with the last verse sandwiched between them (as is performed at official occassions) is a description of the flag and coat of arms of Honduras.

The current anthem is like many others in Latin America in that the music has an operatic, “epic” feel to it (the composer was born in Germany), and has many verses (in this case, seven), which schoolchildren are expected to memorize in its entirety as a way of learning the country’s history, even though the chorus and the last verse are usually only used on official occasions. As such, it can be classified as a “Latin American epic anthem”.
A unique aspect of the Honduran anthem, however, is that it chronicles the history of the country in its seven verses. The first verse describes the country as Christopher Columbus, the first European to land in Honduras, would have seen it. The second tells of how men “from a country where the sun rises” dreamt of Honduras and go out to seek it. Upon arrival, they find that a flag (Spain’s) has been placed there. The third verse chronicles the native population’s attempted resistance against the Spanish. The fourth speaks of the three centuries under Spanish rule, and how requests for change from the colonies, like Honduras, were unheeded; until one day when news of revolution in Europe reached the Americas. Verse 5 continues this thought, stating how the French revolution was a model for those in Honduras seeking redress from Spain. The next verse (verse six) chronicles the revolutions that occurred in the Spanish colonies in America, as one by one they gained liberation from Spain, including Honduras (as part of the Central American federation, at first.) The final verse is a cry to all Hondurans to defend the nation, even in death if necessary.
The chorus, sung after each verse and at the start of the anthem (if all verses are sung), or at the start and end of the anthem, with the last verse sandwiched between them (as is performed at official occassions) is a description of the flag and coat of arms of Honduras.

CHORUS:
Your flag is a splendour of sky
Crossed with a band of snow;
And there can be seen, in its sacred depths,
Five pale blue stars.
In your emblem, which a rough sea
With its wild waves protects,
Behind the bare summit of a volcano,
A star brightly shines.

Chorus

1. Like an Indian maiden you have been sleeping,
Lulled by the resonant song of your seas,
When, set in your golden valleys,
The bold navigator found you;
And on seeing, enraptured, your beauty,
And feeling your enchantment,
He dedicated a kiss of love to the blue hem
of your splendid mantle.

Chorus

2. From a country where the sun rises,
Beyond the blue Atlantic,
That man who had dreamt you
In search of you he launched to sea.
When you raised your pale forehead,
In the lively anxiousness of your hope,
Under the gentle dome of your sky
Already floated a strange banner.

Chorus

3. It was useless that your beloved Indian
Rushed into the fight with ire,
Because, covered with his blood, Lempira,
In the deep night he sank;
And of the heroic deed, in memory,
The legend alone has kept
A sepulcher in a forgotten place,
And the severe profile of a mountain peak.

Chorus

4. For three centuries your children heard
The imperious mandate of the master;
For three centuries your useless complaint
In the blue atmosphere was lost
But one glorious day your ear
Perceived, powerful and distant,
That there, far away, over the Atlantic,
Indignantly, a lion roared

Chorus

5. It was France, the free, the heroic,
Which in its dreams of centuries slept,
Awoke irate to life
At the virile protest of Danton:
It was France, who sent to the death
The head of the consecrated King,
And which built up proudly at its side,
The altar of the goddess of Reason.

Chorus

6. You also, oh my country!, arose
From your servile deep sleep;
You also showed the world
The infamous shackle destroyed.
And in your blessed soil, behind the tall
Hair of the wild jungle,
Like a bird of black feathers,
The fleeting colony was lost.

Chorus

7. To guard this sacred emblem
We shall march, oh fatherland, to our death;
Our death will be honoured
If we die thinking of your love.
Having defended your holy flag,
And shrouded in its glorious folds,
Many, Honduras, shall die for you,
But shall fall in honour.

hu,Hungary,https://nationalanthems.info/hu.htm,16,"Kölcsey’s poem, written in 1823, is set in the 17th century when Hungary was torn into three parts: the independent Hungarian principality in Transylvania, the Turkish occupied central Hungary and the remaining Austrian royal (Habsburg) areas in the north and the west. The subtitle of the poem is ‘A magyar nép zivataros századaiból’ meaning approximately ‘From the Stormy Centuries of the Hungarian People’.

The anthem was adopted in 1844, while Hungary was still a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The title of the Hungarian anthem is often (incorrectly) given as the first line of the anthem,”Isten, áldd meg a magyart”, but the title of the poem (“Himnusz”) is the official title of the anthem. While the poem has eight verses, it is almost always just the first verse that is performed, yet the entire poem remains the official anthem.

Also widely used in Hungary, but not an official national anthem, is the song “Szózat”, which can be described as the “national song” and is often sung in national celebrations. During the first years of Communist rule, it was debated by the legislators of the time to replace “Himnusz” with “Szózat, as Himnusz is a prayer and Hungary, under Communist rule, was officially atheist, but this was never done. Instead, it was often performed without the words.

English translation
1. O Lord, bless the nation of Hungary
With your grace and bounty
Extend toward it your guarding arm
During strife with its enemies
Long torn by ill fate
Bring upon it a time of relief
This nation has suffered for all sins
Of the past and of the future!

2. You brought our ancestors up
Over the Carpathians’ holy peaks
By You was won a beautiful homeland
For Bendegúz’s sons
And wherever flow the rivers of
The Tisza and the Duna
Árpád our hero’s descendants
Will root and bloom.

3. For us on the plains of the Kuns
You ripened the wheat
In the grape fields of Tokaj
You dripped sweet nectar
Our flag you often planted
On the wild Turk’s earthworks
And under Mátyás’ grave army whimpered
Vienna’s “proud fort.”

4. Hajh, but for our sins
Anger gathered in Your bosom
And You struck with Your lightning
From Your thundering clouds
Now the plundering Mongols’ arrows
You swarmed over us
Then the Turks’ slave yoke
We took upon our shoulders.

5. How often came from the mouths
Of Osman’s barbarian nation
Over the corpses of our defeated army
A victory song!
How often did your own son agress
My homeland, upon your breast,
And you became because of your own sons
Your own sons’ funeral urn!

6. The fugitive hid, and towards him
The sword reached into his cave
Looking everywhere he could not find
His home in his homeland
Climbs the mountain, descends the valley
Sadness and despair his companions
Sea of blood beneath his feet
Ocean of flame above.

7. Castle stood, now a heap of stones
Happiness and joy fluttered,
Groans of death, weeping
Now sound in their place.
And Ah! Freedom does not bloom
From the blood of the dead,
Torturous slavery’s tears fall
From the cold eyes of the orphans!

8. Redeem, O Lord, the Hungarians
Who are tossed by waves of danger
Extend toward it your guarding arm
On the sea of its misery
Long torn by ill fate
Bring upon it a time of relief
They who have suffered for all sins
Of the past and of the future!

is,Iceland,https://nationalanthems.info/is.htm,4,"Much like the United States anthem, the Icelandic national anthem was originally written for a particular occasion and it probably did not occur to either the poet or the composer that the song was destined to become a national anthem.

In Iceland, nation-wide celebrations were held throughout 1874 to mark the 1000th anniversary of the first Norse settlement of the island. (This is the “Iceland’s thousand years” that are referenced in the anthem.) To mark the occassion, the Bishop of Iceland decreed that church services on August 2 of that year were to be held based on the anniversary, and the text to be presented was Psalm 90. The Rev. Matthías Jochumsson then decided to write a poem based on the Biblical text and the millennial anniversary. While abroad in Edinburgh, Scotland, he met up with Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson, who Jochumsson asked to compose music for his poem.

While popular, it was not considered a national anthem. Icelandic independence was still over 40 years away. At the time that “Ó, Guð vors lands” (O, God of Our Land) was written, Icelanders usually sang “Eldgamla Ísafold” by Bjarni Thorarensen as a national anthem. However, that song had anti-Danish (the colonial power) lyrics and was set to the tune of the British national anthem. Therefore “Ó, Guð vors lands” (O, God of Our Land) was played as the national anthem when soverignity was proclaimed in 1918. The anthem has three verses, but the first is usually the one sung.

in,India,https://nationalanthems.info/in.htm,18,"India’s various ethnic and cultural groups are honoured in the national anthem, and the melody is very reminiscent of Indian music as well. The music and words (including the English translation) were written by Rabindranath Tagore, the same composer of the music and words of the national anthem of Bangladesh. The poem originally was written (in Bengali) in 1911 with five verses, only the first verse is the national anthem.

The subject of the song is the Universal Spirit that guides India (God), possibly as a unifying link to the varying ethnic groups of the nation. It was first used as a national anthem by the “Free State of India” (Axis-controlled India) from 1943-1945. It was officially adopted as India’s national anthem two days before the republic was declared in 1950. At the time of adoption, another “national song” “Vande Mataram” was popular with the people and many government leaders, but the fact that Vandemataram personified India as a Goddess was offensive to the monothestic Muslim population and led to Jana-gana-mana’s adoption as the national anthem.

ie,Ireland,https://nationalanthems.info/ie.htm,4,"The text of Amhrán na bhFiann, consisting of three stanzas and a chorus, was written in 1907. It was first published in the newspaper, Irish Freedom in 1912. The chorus solely was quietly adopted as the National Anthem in 1926, amid much discussion about the national anthem. The anthem was originally written in English, the later Irish translation by Liam Ó Rinn is much more commonly sung in the country. A section of the National Anthem (consisting of the first four bars followed by the last five) is also the Presidential Salute.

There has been some criticism about the anthem due to its militant nature and anti-British tone. The words “Fianna Fáil” (Warriors of Ireland) appear in Ó Rinn’s translation, later adopted as the name of an Irish political party, some advocate this be changed to “laochra fáil” (heroes of Ireland) instead. Also, some have argued that the melody is difficult to play, whereas others have pointed out that the whole song has been performed, instead of the chorus (which is the official anthem), or has been played at the wrong speed, both of which have happened at recent Olympic Games.

An anthem composed by Phillip Coulter called “Irelands Call” is used as a non-sectarian anthem, which is used by athletes from both Ireland and Northern Ireland when competing together as a unified team.

il,Israel,https://nationalanthems.info/il.htm,23,"The origins of “Hatikvah” far predate its use as the Israeli national anthem, in use since soon after its founding as the first Jewish state in modern history. The music is based on a folk song of unknown origin, but appears several times in European folk songs and religious music. The arrangement by Shmuel Cohen from 1888 is probably based on a Romanian folk song he heard during his childhood in Romania, most likely “Carul cu boi” (“The Ox Driven Cart”). The melody also somewhat resembles Smetana’s symphonic poem “Ma Vlast”, which in turn was based on a Swedish version of the Romanian song. The melody is unique in that it is in a minor key, rare among national anthems; however the lyrics (that speak of a “hope”) are of a more uplifting nature.

The lyrics of the anthem were taken from the first verse and chorus from Naftali Herez Imber’s 1878 poem “Tikavatenu” (Our Hope), which had nine stanzas. At the first Zionist congress of 1897, it was adopted as the anthem of Zionism. The lyrics (primarily of the chorus) underwent a few changes between that time and the creation of the Jewish state of Israel some 50 years later, primarily a change where the song once spoke of a hope to return Zion, it now speaks of a hope to live as a free nation there.

There has been criticisms of the anthem both from Jews who feel the anthem is too secular, and from non-Jews who feel the anthem focusses too much on the Jewish population.

it,Italy,https://nationalanthems.info/it.htm,21,"Different versions exist as to how of how Goffredo Mameli, a young poet, came to write the anthem in 1847. One reports that Mameli took the anthem to the musician Michele Novaro, a friend, who lived in Turin. Novaro composed the music, and Mameli returned to Genoa where he presented words and music to his friends. Shortly thereafter, “Fratelli D’Italia” (Brothers of Italy, another common name for the anthem) was played for the first time, at a popular assembly. The tune gained popularity throughout the peninsula, in defiance of the Austrian, Bourbon and Papal police.

The other and equally persuasive story goes that one evening in 1847, in the house of the American consul, the center of discussion was the uprisings of the day. Urged by many of the consul’s guests, Mameli improvised a few lines on the spot and later wrote the rest. A few days later a friend took the poem to Turin and read it aloud at a nobleman’s party. The composer Michele Novaro who was a guest at the same party, tried a few notes on the piano and then, went home to compose the song. The anthem was sung for the first time the next day by a group of political exiles in the Caffè della Lega Italiana of Turin.

“Il Canto degli Italiani” (the official title) was chosen in October, 1946 as the national anthem to replace the royal anthem after becoming a republic, however, it was on a provisional basis, and although the intent was to make it the official anthem, it wasn’t until 2017 that it was codified in law.

There are slight differences between Mameli’s original poem and how the anthem is sung today. The song is usually sung with the first verse repeated twice then the chorus repeated twice. (If subsequent verses are sung, they are only sung once, this is how the lyrics are presented below). It is also customary to end with “Sì!” (Yes!), perhaps to match the last note of the song.

There is talk lately of replacing the anthem, firstly because the music is not up to the standards of Italian classical music tradition (ironically, some of Italy’s greatest composers have composed anthems in this tradition, which are used by Central and South American countries, giving birth to the term “Latin American epic anthem”), and also the lyrics refer to specific events that were familiar to the Italians of the time that the anthem was composed, but bear little to no resonance with today’s Italians. However, “Il Canto degli Italiani” is very recognizable in Italy and would be hard to replace.

gather us all.
The hour has struck

Union and love
Show the people
The way of the Lord.
Let us swear to free
Our native soil;
United under God,
Who can defeat us?

Every man has the heart

The children of Italy
Are all called Balilla;
Every trumpet blast
sounds the Vespers.

they’re feeble reeds.
The Austrian eagle
Has already lost its plumes.
The blood of Italy
and the Polish blood
It drank, along with the Cossack,
But it burned its heart.

jp,Japan,https://nationalanthems.info/jp.htm,22,"While in use since the early 1880s as a national anthem on a de facto basis, and the words to the anthem are from the tenth century or earlier, making “Kimigayo” the oldest national anthem in that sense, the government only officially adopted the anthem in 1999. The government presented its interpretation of the meaning of the anthem “Kimigayo” in the Diet during the deliberation of a bill to codify the country’s national flag and anthem. At the plenary session of the House of Representatives of the Diet held on June 29, 1999, Prime Minister Obuchi explained as follows: “Kimi in ‘Kimigayo’, under the current Constitution of Japan, indicates the Emperor, who is the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people, deriving his position from the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power; ‘Kimigayo’ as a whole depicts the state of being of our country, which has the Emperor – deriving his position from the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power – as the symbol of itself and of the unity of the people; and it is appropriate to interpret the words of the anthem as praying for the lasting prosperity and peace of our country.”

It is not known who first wrote the words of the anthem. They first appeared in the Kokinshu, a collection “of ancient and modern poems” dating from the tenth century. From very early times, the poem was recited to commemorate auspicious occasions and at banquets celebrating important events. The words were often put to music and were also used in fairy tales and other stories and even appeared in the Edo-period popular fiction known as ukiyo-zoshi and in collections of humorous kyoka (mad verse).

When the Meiji period began in 1868 and Japan made its start as a modern nation, there was not yet anything called a “national anthem.” In 1869 the British military band instructor John William Fenton, who was then working in Yokohama, learned that Japan lacked a national anthem and told the members of Japan’s military band about the British national anthem “God Save the King.” Fenton emphasized the necessity of a national anthem and proposed that he would compose the music if someone would provide the words. The band members requested Artillery Captain Oyama Iwao, who was well versed in Japanese and Chinese history and literature, to select appropriate words for such an anthem. Fenton put his own music to the “Kimigayo” words selected by Oyama, and the first “Kimigayo” anthem was the result. The melody was, however, completely different from the one known today. It was performed, with the accompaniment of brass instruments, during an army parade in 1870, but it was later considered to be lacking in solemnity, and it was agreed that a revision was needed. In 1876, Osamu Yusuke, the director of the Naval Band, submitted to the Navy Ministry a proposal for changing the music, and on the basis of his proposal it was decided that the new melody should reflect the style used in musical chants performed at the imperial court. In July 1880, four persons were named to a committee to revise the music. They were Naval Band director Nakamura Yusuke; Army Band director Yotsumoto Yoshitoyo; the court director of gagaku (Japanese court music) performances, Hayashi Hiromori; and a German instructor under contract with the navy, Franz Eckert. Finally a melody produced by Hiromori Hayashi was selected on the basis of the traditional scale used in gagaku. Eckert made a four-part vocal arrangement, and the new national anthem was first performed in the imperial palace on the Meiji Emperor’s birthday, November 3, 1880. This was the beginning of the “Kimigayo” national anthem we know today.

There has been some opposition lately to the “Kimigayo” both within Japan and in other east Asian countries, for its association with militarism, and for the virtual worship of the emperor in the lyrics.

1. Sky of golden sun,
Steppe of golden seed,
Legend of courage –
Take a look at my country!

From antiquity
Our heroic glory emerged,
They did not give up their pride
My Kazakh people are strong!

CHORUS:
My country, my country,
As your flower I will be planted,
As your song I will stream, my country!
My native land – My Kazakhstan!

2. The way was opened to posterity
I have a vast land.
Its unity is proper,
I have an independent country.

It welcomed the time
Like an eternal friend,
Our country is happy,
Such is our country.

ke,Kenya,https://nationalanthems.info/ke.htm,3,"Kenya’s was the first anthem in Africa to be written by a group commissioned by the government. One of the goals of the group was to incorporate traditional Kenyan music in the anthem, the resulting anthem, therefore, has a very African feel to it, a typical example of the “Eastern folk” style of anthem. The melody is actually based on a traditional Kenyan folk song, sung by mothers to their children.

Other criteria the group was charged with to create the anthem was that the tune had to be of the right length and quality, yet possesing the necessary dignity. It also had to lend itself to having words written for it, in both English and Swahili (the official languages of the country). The words had to unify the nation, yet contain the aspirations of the whole country. And the melody had to be able to be performed by a military band, without impairing the original feel of the song. With all those goals in mind, the anthem was ready in time for independence in December, 1963.

kp,North Korea,https://nationalanthems.info/kp.htm,18,"A year before the establishment of North Korea in 1948, the government of the then Soviet-controlled sector of Korea adopted a new anthem (the one in use at that time was the anthem of South Korea with its former melody of the Scottish tune “Auld Lang Syne”). Unlike most North Korean patriotic songs, the anthem does not mention either the ruling party or the founder of the nation. The title of the anthem is also the same as South Korea’s (as well as that of the predecessor to the Koreas, the Korean Empire), and the music is somewhat similar to the South Korean one as well. There has also been a “united Korean anthem” created by blending the melodies of the anthems of North and South Korea seamlessly, used by some to promote Korean re-unification.

There also exists a patriotic song, “Song of General Kim Il Sung” which, while not the official national anthem of the country, is a very popular patriotic song and, unlike the national anthem, does reference the ruling family and founder of the country, and thus is used more in the country as part of the government’s mission to spread information about the founder of North Korea to its citizens. As such, it is taught in schools and played at public gatherings more frequently than the national anthem is.

kr,South Korea,https://nationalanthems.info/kr.htm,20,"First performed in 1896, it was well-known by all Koreans by 1910. (It was not the national anthem at this time however, as an imperial anthem was in use at the time.) At this time, the song was usually sung to a Scottish folk song, “Auld Lang Syne”, as well as occasionally to other music. In that year, the Japanese invaded Korea, and banned the song. However, it was still popular with Koreans abroad as a yearning for national independence.

In 1935 composer Ahn Eaktay wrote the music that’s currently in use for the anthem (he wanted the song to have a Korean melody and not that of a folk song of a foreign nation). It was adopted by the government in exile and then, when South Korea was founded in 1948, three years after the Japanese occupation ended, it was officially adopted by that government.

The anthem shares a title with that of the anthem of North Korea, as well as that of the Korean Empire, the music is also somewhat reminiscent of that of North Korea’s anthem.

Arabic lyrics (Romanization)



















English translation
1. All of us! For our Country, for our Flag and Glory!
Our valour and our writings are the envy of the ages.
Our mountains and our valleys, they bring forth stalwart men.
And to Perfection all our efforts we devote.
All of us! For our Country, for our Flag and Glory!
All of us! For our Country

2. Our Elders and our children, they await our Country’s call,
And on the Day of Crisis they are as Lions of the Jungle.
The heart of our East is ever Lebanon,
May God preserve her until end of time.
All of us! For our Country, for our Flag and Glory!
All of us! For our Country

3. The Gems of the East are her land and sea.
Throughout the world her good deeds flow from pole to pole.
And her name is her glory since time began.
Immortality’s Symbol–the Cedar–is her Pride.
All of us! For our Country, for our Flag and Glory!
All of us! For our Country

ls,Lesotho,https://nationalanthems.info/ls.htm,17,"Both the melody and the lyrics of this anthem come from European sources (in the case of the melody, not even composed to be the anthem of Lesotho). As such, there is debate in the country about the anthem, not only because the melody and lyrics were by foreigners, but also because the lyrics do not fit the melody perfectly. However, the anthem has been kept since it was first adopted.

The melody was from a Swiss songbook from around 1823. The composer was Ferdinand-Samuel Naegeli (later known as Ferdinand-Samuel Laur). The song that was later used as the Lesothan anthem was titled “Freiheit” (Freedom). Despite being from a Swiss songbook, the musical style is similar to that of anthems of other nations in the area in the “Eastern folk” style, perhaps indicating the melody was “Africanized” sometime after it was first introduced to the country.

The lyrics were by a French missionary to the area named François Coillard. Coillard grew up near the French-Swiss border, close to the area where Laur’s songbook was released, so Coillard may have known of the melody from there. The anthem first appeared in a Lesothan collection of songs for high schools in 1869.

The anthem originally had five verses, but by the 20th century, only the first and last verses were used, the middle verses, written to abolish traditional customs and religions, were deemed inappropriate.

The anthem was adopted in 1967 by a royal decree, which was backdated to Independence Day, October 4, 1966.

ly,Libya,https://nationalanthems.info/ly.htm,22,"Becoming an independent kingdom in late 1951, a competition was held the following year for a national anthem. The winning entry, “Libya, Libya, Libya”, was first performed at the wedding of King Idris in 1955. The composer of the music also wrote the music for the anthems of Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates. The anthem was used until the monarchy was abolished in a coup by Moammar Qadaffi in 1969, when it was replaced with a new anthem.

During the 2011 Libyan civil war, the rebel forces against Qadafi’s government used the former anthem from the monarchy period as the Libyan national anthem in the areas that they control. Upon the effective loss of power of the Qadaffi regime, “Libya, Libya, Libya” was restored as the national anthem, with the third verse that mentions the king not being used (it is still sometimes heard, or sometimes it is altered to mention other famous Libyan patriots). (The fourth verse of the original is now the third verse).

lt,Lithuania,https://nationalanthems.info/lt.htm,18,"Poet Vincas Kudirka, also a Lithuanian patriot, wrote a 50-word poem on his views of the Lithuanian nation while it was still part of Czarist Russia. Written in 1898, he also wrote the music after the poem was written shortly before his death the following year.

The song was first performed shortly before his death for a group of Lithuanians in St. Petersburg and was first performed in Lithuania itself in 1905 and was declared as the national anthem upon declaration of independence from Russia in 1918 and remained so until Lithuania was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.

During the period of Soviet occupation, “Tautiška giesmė” was forbidden to be sung and a new anthem was written for the republic within the Soviet Union. As early as 1988, when democratic reforms were being implemented in the USSR, “Tautiška giesmė” was being suggested as a replacement anthem for the Lithuanian SSR. In 1990, Lithuania was the first Soviet Republic to declare independence from the USSR and “Tautiška giesmė” was again made the anthem of an independent Lithuania.

mk,North Macedonia,https://nationalanthems.info/mk.htm,18,"The national anthem of North Macedonia was created in 1943 by Vlado Maleski, a poet from Struga. It was adopted as the anthem of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia while in Yugoslavia after World War II. The song was later selected to be the anthem of the newly independent Republic of Macedonia after its independence in 1991. Upon resolution with Greece (who has neighbouring departments that also contain the name Macedonia), the country’s name was changed in 2019 to North Macedonia, but the lyrics of the anthem still refer to the name Macedonia.

When the Sultan’s aide was asked what the anthem of Perak was, so that it could be played upon his formal arrival, the aide, not wanting to be embarrassed by saying that Perak did not have an anthem, perhaps giving the impression that his country was “backwards”, proceeded to hum a favourite tune of his from the Seychelles, which is believed to have been composed by Pierre Jean Beranger. It was, therefore, from that moment on, the tune for the state anthem of Perak.

After an Indonesian opera performed it in Singapore (at the time, part of Malaysia), the tune became popular throughout all of Malaysia in the 1920s and 1930s as the love song “Terang Bulan” (Moonlight). (“Terang Bulan” is now forbidden to be performed in Malaysia.)

Before independence was scheduled for Malaysia in 1957, each of the (then) eleven states of Malaysia had their own anthem (which they have retained to this day), but there was no unifying anthem for the whole country. When independence was approaching, Tunku Abdul Rahman, then the Chief Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (later Malaysia’s first prime minister), led a committee to select a new anthem. Hundreds were recieved, but none were deemed suitable. Finally, the anthem for the Malaysian state of Perak was considered, and the melody, due to its “traditional flavour” was selected to be the melody for the new anthem.

Once the melody was selected, new lyrics had to be written for it. The panel of judges charged with selecting a new anthem wrote the lyrics, with Tunku Abdul Rahman leading the group.

In 1992, the anthem was rearranged to give it a livelier, march rhythym, which was unpopular with the citizens. In 2003 the tempo was returned to what it was originally.

There exists a full version of the anthem, as well as a shorter version, both presented here. The full version is generally used in the presence of the King of Malaysia, the shorter version is used to honour the Queen of Malaysia and lesser officials.

mv,Maldives,https://nationalanthems.info/mv.htm,24,"Until the late 1940s the state anthem of the Maldives was a melody with no lyrics. It was called the Salaamathi and was performed by the royal band on state occasions at the Etherekoilu, the official residence of the King.

In 1948 it was determined that the Salaamathi needed replacement with lyrics to accompany a new melody. The words were composed by a young poet and later a chief justice, Mohamed Jameel Didi.

Jameel Didi looked around for a tune to accompany his poem. His uncle, the chief justice Hussain Salahuddine, had just acquired a new clock that played a tune at the stroke of midday, the Scottish folk song “Auld Lang Syne”, and Jameel decided to use that tune for his poem (slightly modified to fit the words).

Although the Salaamathi survived as the royal anthem until 1964, it did not occur to anyone to adopt it as the national anthem. In 1972, for the first time in history, the Maldives hosted a foreign head of state – Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. The Maldive government of the time deemed it necessary to compose a different tune for the anthem instead. Hastily they commissioned the composition of a new melody. The new melody of the Maldive national anthem was composed by a distinguished Sri Lankan maestro, Pandit Wannakuwattawaduge Don Amaradeva. The original lyrics were used, with some changes to mark the fact that Maldives has been a republic since 1968.

Although as many as seven verses can be found for this anthem, it seems that the most common representation is the first two verses, which is what is presented here.

ml,Mali,https://nationalanthems.info/ml.htm,13,"Mali first gained independence in June of 1960 in a federation with Senegal called the Mali Federation. The anthem of the federation, titled “Un Hymn du Mali” (A Song of Mali), used music based on an old folk tune, possibly dating from the Mali Empire of the 13th century. The lyrics for the federation’s anthem, however, were written by a Senegalese man who would go on to be Senegal’s first president when the union dissolved two months later. While the music was written by a Malian and thus adopted by the new nation of Mali, new lyrics were written by a prominent writer and politician, and adopted as the new national anthem two years later. Despite the title commonly being given as the first line of either the chorus or the first verse, the anthem’s official title is “Le Mali”.

One people, one goal, one faith
For a united Africa.

Within or without,
On the ramparts,
We are ready to stand and die.

For Africa and for you, Mali,
Our banner shall be liberty.
For Africa and for you, Mali,
Our fight shall be for unity.
Oh, Mali of today,

And hearts are thrilling with confidence.

2. Stand up, towns and countryside,
Stand up, women, stand up young and old,
For the Fatherland on the road
Towards a radiant future.
For the sake of our dignity
Let us strengthen our ranks;
For the public well-being
Let us forge the common good.
Together, shoulder to shoulder,
Let us work for happiness.

3. The road is hard, very hard,

Let us march towards unity.
Refound dignity
Supports our struggle.
Faithful to our oath
To make a united Africa,

mn,Mongolia,https://nationalanthems.info/mn.htm,20,"Mongolia’s current anthem has been in place since 1950, yet has undergone several changes in its lyrics. The original lyrics were replaced in 1961, perhaps partly due to the mention of Stalin in the original lyrics, as the Communist world underwent a process of “de-Stalinization” after his death in 1953; it has been reported that between the time of his death and the replacement of the lyrics in 1961, the second verse was not performed.

After the transition to democracy from Communism in 1990, the original lyrics from 1950-1961 were restored, but with slight changes, removing the references of Communist heroes. In July, 2006, the lyrics were slightly revised again, and both verses now have their own unique refrain.

Mongolia’s current anthem has been in place since 1950, yet has undergone several changes in its lyrics. The original lyrics were replaced in 1961, perhaps partly due to the mention of Stalin in the original lyrics, as the Communist world underwent a process of “de-Stalinization” after his death in 1953; it has been reported that between the time of his death and the replacement of the lyrics in 1961, the second verse was not performed.
After the transition to democracy from Communism in 1990, the original lyrics from 1950-1961 were restored, but with slight changes, removing the references of Communist heroes. In July, 2006, the lyrics were slightly revised again, and both verses now have their own unique refrain.

ma,Morocco,https://nationalanthems.info/ma.htm,16,"The tune of “Hymne Chérifien” was already in use in Morocco when it was a French protectorate, along with a different set of lyrics. Upon independence in 1956, the anthem was confirmed, but the lyrics were not. A new set of lyrics was written in 1970. The “Sharif” of the title is a term given to one who is a protector of the tribe and all its assets.

mm,Myanmar,https://nationalanthems.info/mm.htm,23,"In 1930, Saya Tin was a member of the “Dobama Asiayone” (“We Burmans”) group that was a Burmese nationalist group against the controlling British government. He composed the song “Kaba Ma Kyei” as the party song and first performed it on July 20, 1930. Tin was promptly arrested for inciting rebellion and was jailed until 1946. Meanwhile, the song became a national symbol during British rule and then the Japanese occupation.

In 1947, before independence, a committee was formed to select proposals for the future flag, coat of arms and national anthem. Saya Tin became a member of this committee in July 1947. It was decided to adopt Tin’s composition with some slight changes of the text. On 22nd September 1947, another correction of the text was done and this version became official upon independence in 1948. (A slight change was also made to the words, presumably in 1988, when the name of the country was changed to Myanmar).

Two versions of the anthem exist, a short one when played internationally, and a longer one that adds a more Burmese type of music to the beginning of the piece that is performed domestically. There is also an interesting custom associated with the national anthem, and that is that singers who sing the anthem must give a small bow upon the conclusion of their singing, as a sign of respect for the anthem and the nation.

nl,Netherlands,https://nationalanthems.info/nl.htm,5,"The Dutch national anthem is one of the oldest anthems in existence, the melody was known from before 1572 as a French Huguenot melody titled “Charles”, and the song first appeared in 1626 in a collection of songs assembled by Adriaan Valerius. Philips van Marnix van Sint Aldegonde is widely credited as the author, but as this is very much in dispute, the author is at this point basically unknown. It was not approved as the official national anthem until 1932.

“Het Wilhelmus” has 15 eight-line verses (the first verse, and sometimes the sixth, is most commonly performed). Based on older songs, the Wilhelmus takes the form of an acrostic on the name of William of Orange, the leader of the Dutch revolt against Philip II of Spain.

The song’s style resembles that of the work of the Rederijkers (“rhetoricians”), sixteenth-century companies of poets. For example, the first letters of the 15 verses spell the name “Willem van Nassov” (in the original orthography, the modern Dutch version has the acrostic spell “Willem van Nazzov”). The text is also thematically symmetrical, in that verses one and 15 resemble on another in meaning, as do verses two and 14, three and 13, etc., until they converge in the eighth verse, the heart of the song: “Oh David, thou soughtest shelter / From King Saul’s tyranny”. The words of the song also highly resemble the poems in the biblical book of Psalms. (The English versification to the right is meant to preserve not only the rhyming scheme and rhythm so that it can be sung to the melody, but also the symmetry of the verses and the acrostic.)

Another fact about the anthem that is often in dispute is the use of the word “Duitsen” in the second line of the first verse. Often translated as “German”, William’s birthplace indeed lies in modern-day Germany, however, Germany as a nation would not exist for another 300 years (the area still being known as the “Holy Roman Empire”). Only in modern Dutch has “Duits” come to mean “German” in all uses. Others have interpreted the word to mean “of the people”, which of course makes it more inclusive of the Dutch people. This site prefers “Germanic” as the translation; the original lyrics read “van Duytschen bloet”, “Duytschen” referring not to Germany (as it has been established that there was no such nation at the time), but to the lowlands area, which includes the modern-day Netherlands and certain areas of Germany, including where William of Orange was born; the word therefore highlighted William’s local origins. “Germanic” may be the best modern word to cover the original intent and area inferred.

Special thanks to: Jan Scotland, Maarten de Zeeuw, Marjan Meijer, and Margriet Verbeek for some of this information."
ni,Nicaragua,https://nationalanthems.info/ni.htm,20,"The melody of the anthem goes back to the 1700s as a liturgical anthem in Spain. It was brought to Nicaragua shortly before independence in 1821, and was declared as the country’s first official anthem sometime between 1835 and 1837. The wordless melody was used until 1876, when it was replaced with the song “Soldados, ciudadanos” (Soldiers, Citizens). (This anthem may have been wordless until 1889). It was replaced yet again in 1893 after General José Santos Zelaya took over the country; the anthem “Hermosa Soberana” (Beautiful Sovereign) was composed by Zelaya’s son-in-law Alejandro Cousin and was written by either Rubén Darío, Santiago Argüello or Manuel Maldonado. Despite being replaced in 1910 after Zelaya fled the country, the song remains a popular patriotic song in Nicaragua.

After decades of political upheaval, which was reflected in the anthem, it was decided to bring stability back to the country by bringing stability to the anthem, so the first anthem, the piece of liturgical music brought over from Spain nearly 90 years previously, was reinstated as the anthem, but had to be recreated from memory as no written record of the music was found. Also, emergency lyrics were written by Marco Antonio Ortega under the title “La Patria Amada” (The Beloved Homeland) until a contest could be held for new lyrics.

The first priority was to arrange the old music of the national anthem, and Luis Abraham Delgadillo, a Nicaraguan composer who studied in Milan, was chosen to arrange the anthem. In 1918, the key of the anthem was changed to G major and it was made to be played by a band more easily; the new arrangement made the anthem also sound more like other “Latin American epic anthems” also in use by neighbouring countries. A contest was then held for the new lyrics for the anthem. The requirements were that there be words for both parts of the anthem, the only topic would be peace and work (as a contrast to the political upheavals of recent history) and that the words fit the melody. The winning lyrics were adopted by the government in 1939.

The melody of the anthem goes back to the 1700s as a liturgical anthem in Spain. It was brought to Nicaragua shortly before independence in 1821, and was declared as the country’s first official anthem sometime between 1835 and 1837. The wordless melody was used until 1876, when it was replaced with the song “Soldados, ciudadanos” (Soldiers, Citizens). (This anthem may have been wordless until 1889). It was replaced yet again in 1893 after General José Santos Zelaya took over the country; the anthem “Hermosa Soberana” (Beautiful Sovereign) was composed by Zelaya’s son-in-law Alejandro Cousin and was written by either Rubén Darío, Santiago Argüello or Manuel Maldonado. Despite being replaced in 1910 after Zelaya fled the country, the song remains a popular patriotic song in Nicaragua.
After decades of political upheaval, which was reflected in the anthem, it was decided to bring stability back to the country by bringing stability to the anthem, so the first anthem, the piece of liturgical music brought over from Spain nearly 90 years previously, was reinstated as the anthem, but had to be recreated from memory as no written record of the music was found. Also, emergency lyrics were written by Marco Antonio Ortega under the title “La Patria Amada” (The Beloved Homeland) until a contest could be held for new lyrics.
The first priority was to arrange the old music of the national anthem, and Luis Abraham Delgadillo, a Nicaraguan composer who studied in Milan, was chosen to arrange the anthem. In 1918, the key of the anthem was changed to G major and it was made to be played by a band more easily; the new arrangement made the anthem also sound more like other “Latin American epic anthems” also in use by neighbouring countries. A contest was then held for the new lyrics for the anthem. The requirements were that there be words for both parts of the anthem, the only topic would be peace and work (as a contrast to the political upheavals of recent history) and that the words fit the melody.

ng,Nigeria,https://nationalanthems.info/ng.htm,4,"Nigeria’s anthem the result of a contest held a year before 1960 independence and the winning entry, which focused on unity, was written by a British expatriate[1] and was in use until 1978, when the military dictatorship leading the country changed the anthem and was used during the dictatorship a as a form of protest against the government. The new anthem was retained even after civilian power was returned to the country.

In 2024 the president decided to reintroduce it as the anthem in May of that year, passing it into law on the 29th of that month[2]. Since this anthem was written by a Briton (the former colonial power), and due to the fact that the government replaced the anthem quicker than the usual legislative process, seemingly at the expense of other matters, there was opposition to this move from members of the public.[3]. Similar to previously, those who support President Tinbu and his decision to change the anthem sing this anthem, while those against the president and his policies, including the change, continue using the old one.

no,Norway,https://nationalanthems.info/no.htm,18,"The words for the national anthem, written by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, one of Norway’s great dramatists and poets, were first published in 1859. The original poem had six verses; in 1863 one of the original verses were deleted and three more were added, giving a total of eight verses; the deleted verse was a tribute to King Carl XV, but Bjørnson changed his political views later from monarchism to republicanism, and deleted that verse. Nowadays, the first verse and last two verses are most commonly sung.

The music was composed by Rikard Nordraak, cousin of Bjørnson and a friend of the famed Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg, in 1864. It was first performed later that year for the 50th anniversary of their constitution, and caught on quickly, overtaking “Sønner af Norges” in popularity. It became a part of the reading books in schools all over the country, and was sung by the children in the children’s parades organized by Bjørnson on every 17th of May.

Despite its widespread use as the national anthem, it has never been officially declared as such. It has been the most popular song presented as the anthem since the early twentieth century, and was performed as the national anthem at the time of Norwegian independence in 1905. Since the summer of 2011, the patriotic song “Mitt lille land” has also been referred to as a “new national anthem”, and has been performed at patriotic events, but has not been used as a national anthem as much as “Ja, vi esker” continues to be.

1. Yes, we love this country
as it rises forth,
rugged, weathered, above the sea,
with the thousands of homes.
Love, love it and think
of our father and mother
and the saga night that sends
dreams to our earth.
and the saga night that sends
sends dreams to our earth.

2. This country Harald united
with his army of heroes,
this country Håkon protected
whilst Øyvind sung;
upon the country Olav painted
with his blood the cross,
from its heights Sverre spoke
up against Rome.
from its heights Sverre spoke
spoke up against Rome.

3. Farmers their axes sharpened
wherever an army advanced,
Tordenskiold along the coastline thundered
so that we could see it back home.
Even women stood up and fought
as if they were men;
others could only cry
but that soon would end!
others could only cry
but that soon, that soon would end!

4. Sure, we were not many
but we were enough,
when we were tested sometimes,
and it was at stake;
we would rather burn our land
than to declare defeat;
just remember what happened
down at Fredrikshald!
just remember what happened
what happened down at Fredrikshald!

5. Hard times we have coped with,
were at last disowned;
but in the worst distress, blue-eyed
freedom was to us born.
It gave (us) father’s strength to carry
famine and war,
it gave death itself its honour –
and it gave reconciliation.
it gave death itself its honour –
and it gave, it gave reconciliation.

6. The enemy threw away his weapon,
up the visor went,
we, in wonder, to him hastened,
because he was our brother.
Driven forth to a stand by shame
we went to the south;
now we three brothers stand united,
and shall stand like that!
now we three brothers stand united,
united, and shall stand like that!

7. Norseman in house and cabin,
thank your great God!
The country he wanted to protect,
although things looked dark.
All the fights fathers have fought,
and the mothers have wept,
the Lord has quietly moved
so we won our rights.
the Lord has quietly moved
so we won, we won our rights.

8. Yes, we love this country
as it rises forth,
rugged, weathered, above the sea,
with those thousand homes.
And as the fathers’ struggle has raised
it from need to victory,
even we, when it is demanded,
for its peace, its peace will encamp

pw,Palau,https://nationalanthems.info/pw.htm,1,"Shortly before adopting its first constitution in 1981, Palau’s anthem was officially adopted. At the time part of the U. S. administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, independence was gained in 1994. The lyrics of the anthem are combined from several authors."
py,Paraguay,https://nationalanthems.info/py.htm,20,"Paraguay’s first anthem was adopted in 1831, called “Tetã purahéi”, and written by Anastacio Rolón completely in the native Guaraní language (the ruler of the time, José Gaspar Rodríguez, refused it to be translated into Spanish, and insisted that it always be performed in Guaraní). A later president, Carlos Antonio López, translated it into Spanish in 1845 as the “Himno de la independencia” (Anthem of Independence) as a literal translation of the Guaraní. It is unknown who wrote the music, or what it was.

During López’ presidency, he requested Francisco Esteban Acuña de Figueroa, the lyricist of Uruguay’s anthem, to write a new anthem for the country. It was completed on May 20, 1846 and approved as the national anthem that year. It is unknown who created the original music of the anthem (some sources list Francisco José Debali, who was also the composer of Uruguay’s anthem), but in 1934, Paraguayan composer Remberto Giménez rearranged and developed the version of the anthem in use today.

Paraguay’s anthem is a classic example of a “Latin American epic anthem”. The seven verses of the anthem also resemble other nations’ anthems of this type, for example, the first three verses of Paraguay’s anthem, recalling its history and specific events, is very similar to the theme of Honduras‘ anthem, whereas the fourth verse which praises the national symbols, and the last three verses, which are a call to patriotism, are common themes in these type of anthems.

1. For three centuries a reign oppressed
The unhappy peoples of America,
But one day, their anger aroused, they said:
“An end to this!” and broke the reign.
Our forefathers, fighting magnificently,
Displayed their martial glory,
And when the august diadem was shattered,
They raised the triumphal cap of liberty.

CHORUS:
Paraguayans, Republic or death!
It was our strength that gave us our final liberty.
Neither tyrants nor slaves can continue,
Where unity and equality reign,
Where unity and equality reign.

2. A new Rome, the Fatherland shall proudly display
Two leaders of name and valor
Who, rivals, like Romulus and Remus
Divided government and power.
Long years, during which Phoebus in the clouds
Saw darken the pearl of the South,
Today a grand hero appears
Raising up again her glory and virtue…

Chorus

3. Europe and the world salute her with applause
And also acclaim
Invincible bastion of heroism,
Magnificent Eden of riches.
(But) when discord rumbled all around
Which fatally devoured other Peoples,
Paraguayans, the sacred ground
Was covered by an angel with its wings.

Chorus

4. Oh, how pure, of laurel girded
Sweet Fatherland, in this manner you show yourself.
In your ensign one sees the colors
Of sapphire, diamond, and ruby.
In your coat of arms, which the Sun illuminates,
Under the cap, one sees the lion.
Double image of the strong and the free,
And of glories, the memory and crest.

Chorus

5. From the tomb of vile feudalism
The national Deity rises free;
Oppressors, bend your knees!
Compatriots, entone the hymn!
Sound the cry, “Republic or death”!
Our breasts exhale it with faith,
And the mountains repeat its echoes
Like giants arising.

Chorus

6. Our Fatherland defends liberty and justice;
Tyrants: listen!
The laws in its sacred charter
Will sustain its heroism in the fight.
Against the world, if the world opposes it,
If the world dares to insult her security,
Battling to avenge we shall know her
Or die embracing her.

Chorus

7. Arise, oh People, your splendid sword
That strikes with sparkles of God,
There is no middle ground between free or slave
And an abyss divides the two.
In the gentle breezes the Hymn resounds,
Repeating with triumphal echo:
For the free, renowned glory!
For the Fatherland, immortal laurel!

Chorus

pe,Peru,https://nationalanthems.info/pe.htm,18,"The first leader of Peru declared a contest to compose a new national anthem shortly after independence. The winning anthem, entitled “Marcha Nacional” (National March) was accepted immediately as the new national anthem, and was sung for the first time in the Principal Theatre of Lima on the night of 24 September 1821. In the intervening years, there were efforts to alter the lyrics (partly due to the anthem’s anti-Spanish tone) but in 1913 the lyrics were declared to be sacrosanct and not to be rewritten (previous efforts to do so didn’t catch on in popularity anyway). Despite this, the anthem continued to be revised in the ensuing decades. Different words for the first verse, then the second and third verses, were written, with varying degrees of success, during different presidential regimes but after their terms were over, the lyrics reverted back to the original ones.

In 2005, it was determined that the first verse, which was most commonly sung at the time, was not written by José de la Torre Ugarte, but it had become part of the popular ethos by this time, as well as being part of the 1913 law regarding the intangibleness of the anthem. It was also determined that the original fifth stanza had been excluded from the anthem, and was reinstated as the sixth stanza, making seven stanzas in all. In 2009, the government declared the last verse to be the official verse to be sung when the anthem is played.

CHORUS:
We are free! May we always be so, may we always be so!
and let the sun rather deny its light
its lights, its lights…the sun!
Before allow us to break the solemn vow
which the motherland elevated to the Eternal
Before allow us to break the solemn vow
which the motherland elevated to the Eternal
Before allow us to break the solemn vow
which the motherland elevated to the Eternal.

1. For a long time the oppressed Peruvian
dragged the ominous chain;
sentenced to a cruel servitude
for a long time, for a long time
for a long time in silence he moaned.
But as soon as the sacred cry
“Liberty!” was heard on its coasts,
he shook off the indolence of slavery,
the humiliated, the humiliated
the humiliated neck he raised
the humiliated neck he raised
the neck he raised!.

Chorus

2. Now the roar of rough chains
that we had heard for three centuries of horror
from the free, at the sacred cry
that the world heard astonished, ceased.
Everywhere the inflamed San Martín
“Liberty”, “Liberty” pronounced;
and the Andes, rocking their base,
announced it as well, in unison.

Chorus

3. With its influx the peoples woke up,
and like lighting ran the opinion;
from the Isthmus to Tierra del Fuego,
and from Tierra del Fuego to the icy region.
Everyone vowed to break the link
that Nature denied to both worlds,
and break the sceptre that Spain
had reclined, proud, on both.

Chorus

4. Lima fulfilled this solemn vow,
and, severe, her anger showed
by throwing out the powerless tyrant,
who had been trying to extend his oppression.
On her endeavor the shackles cracked,
and the furrows that she had repaired in herself
stirred up her hatred and vengeance,
inherited from her Inca and Lord.

Chorus

5. Countrymen, may we see her a slave no more.
If for three centuries she moaned, humiliated,
forever may we vow that she be free,
maintaining her own splendor.
Our arms, until today unarmed,
be they always readying the cannon,
that some day the beaches of Iberia
will feel the horror of its roar.

Chorus

6. May we arouse the jealousy of Spain
since it has a premonition, with want and furor,
that in a contest of great nations
our country will enter in comparison.
On the list formed by these
we shall fill the line first,
ahead of the ambitious Iberian tyrant,
who devastated all of America.

Chorus

7. On its summit may the Andes sustain
the two-color flag or standard,
may it announce to the centuries the effort
that being free gave us forever.
Under its shadow may we live calmly
and, at the sun’s birth over its summits,
may we renew the great oath
we rendered to the God of Jacob.

ph,Philippines,https://nationalanthems.info/ph.htm,20,"On June 5, 1898, a week before Philippine independence would be declared, Julian Felipe, a local pianist from Kawit, Cavite, arrived at the home of Maximo Inocencio, one of Cavite’s thirteen martyrs during the revolution. Upon his arrival, the leader of the revolution, General Emilio Aguinaldo, asked Felipe to play a march written by a Filipino in Hong Kong. However, Aguinaldo was not satisfied with this march. Recognizing Felipe’s skills, he asked him to compose a more soul-rousing tune that would install courage and patriotism in the hearts of every Filipino.

On June 11, the day before the declaration of independence, Felipe arrived again and played his tune to the revolutionary leaders. The leaders unanimously approved it as the national hymn. Felipe called his work the “Marcha Filipina Magdalo.” The next day, Felipe’s tune was played during the hoisting of the Philippine flag at the historic window at the Aguinaldo mansion. The march was renamed the “Marcha Nacional Filipina,” and immediately became the National Anthem. However, the anthem still lacked words. The next year, a young soldier named José Palma penned the poem “Filipinas” in Spanish, to match the music of the anthem. It was adopted as the official lyrics.

The Philippines were now under American rule, and as such, a suitable English translation was to be made of the anthem. The first translation was made by Paz Marquez Benitez of the University of the Philippines. However, the most popular version was written by Mary A. Lane and Senator Camillo Osias, known as the “Philippine Hymn”. On December 5, 1938, the Philippine Congress passed Commonwealth Act 382, which made the anthem’s English words and Felipe’s music official.

A Tagalog (the Filipino language) version of the words started appearing in the 1940’s. In 1948, the Department of Education approved “O Sintang Lupa” (O Beloved Land) as the national anthem’s Filipino words. In 1954, Education Secretary Gregorio Hernandez, Jr., created a committee to revise the words. The new version, entitled “Lupang Hinirang,” was adopted (a minor revision was made in 1962), and is still in use today. Since the passage of the 1998 law about the national symbols (RA 8491), the national anthem can only be sung in Tagalog (the national language) and using only the music composed by Felipe. However, that has not prevented other translations from being created, such as Ilonggo.

Beloved country,
Pearl of the Orient,
The heart’s fervor,
In your chest is ever alive.

Chosen land,
You are the cradle of the brave.
To the conquerors,
You shall never win.

Through the seas and mountains,
Through the air and your blue sky,
There is splendor in the poem and song
For beloved freedom.

The sparkle of your flag
Is shining victoriously.
Its stars and sun
Shall forever never dim.

Land of the sun, of glory and our affections,
Life is heaven in your arms;
It is our pleasure, when there are oppressors,
To die for you.

To the conquerors,
You shall never win.

Through the seas and mountains,
Through the air and your blue sky,
There is splendor in the poem and song
For beloved freedom.

The sparkle of your flag
Is shining victoriously.
Its stars and sun
Shall forever never dim.

Land of the sun, of glory and our affections,
Life is heaven in your arms;
It is our pleasure, when there are oppressors,
To die for you.

Beloved country,
Pearl of the Orient,
The heart’s fervor,
In your chest is ever alive.

Chosen land,
You are the cradle of the brave.
To the conquerors,
You shall never win.

Through the seas and mountains,
Through the air and your blue sky,
There is splendor in the poem and song
For beloved freedom.

pl,Poland,https://nationalanthems.info/pl.htm,17,"The Polish national anthem was written in July 1797 in Reggio near Bolonia by Józef Wybicki, one of the organisers of General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski’s Polish Army in Italy. The theme of the original poem was a novel idea in the era of the nation state (that is, most European nations were made up of eponymous nationalities), that the nation does not need a territory to be a nation, it only needs a group of people. This idea was a timely one, as Poland had only been partitioned out of existence only two years earlier. Several more times in subsequent Polish history would an independent Polish nation appear then disappear from the map, which could explain why the song resonates with Poles even today. The original poem also mentions several Polish war heroes of the time, as well as heroes of past Polish wars; also Napoleon is mentioned, as the commanding officer of Dąbrowski and as an example to be held up.

The source of the melody is unclear; it is usually ascribed to Michal Kleofas Oginski, but this has not been determined with certainty. It is most likely based on an anonymous fok song, due to the unusual mazurka tempo (which is often played at a faster rate than most anthems); mazurkas originated in Poland and have always been heavily associated with that nation.

Its familiar mazurka melody and its message – a call to join the fight for independence – inspired numerous 19th century patriotic songs and national hymns of the Slavonic nations under foreign rule (some of which would later become Yugoslavia, which could explain the similar melody of the former Yugoslav anthem.) The opening line of the lyrics was also borrowed by Ukraine (which, of course, speaks of the Ukraine not perishing rather than Poland.) In the early years after Poland’s revival in 1918, during the debate about the choice of the national anthem, several candidates were considered. On February 28, 1927 the choice of “Dąbrowski’s Mazurka” as the national anthem was officially announced.

ro,Romania,https://nationalanthems.info/ro.htm,12,"Written during the 1848 revolution by Andrei Mureşianu and set to the music of Anton Pann by Gheorghe Ucenescu and originally titled “Un răsunet” (An Echo), the poem’s theme of revolution, liberty, and patriotism, quickly became popular with Romanians, especially in subsequent national struggles, earning the song the nickname of the “Romanian Marseillaise“. It was first used as a national anthem by the short-lived Moldavian Democratic Republic in 1917-1918 (and was the first anthem in use by independent Moldova from 1991-1994) and was long regarded as an unofficial Romanian anthem. It was heard frequently during the protests against the communist government in late 1989 and was officially confirmed as the national anthem in the spring of 1990. The original work has eleven verses, but only four (verses 1, 2, 4, and 11) are usually performed as the official lyrics (although on special occasions, such as National Anthem Day (July 29, the anniversary of its first performance in 1848), the full lyrics can sometimes be heard).

Into which you’ve been sunk by the barbaric tyrants
Now, or never, your fate renew,
To which your enemies will bow to.

2. Now or never let’s give proof to the world
That in these veins still flows a Roman blood,
That in our chests we still maintain our pride in a name
The victor in his battles, the name of Trajan!

4. Watch on, shadows of highnesses, Mihai, Stefan, Corvinus,
The Romanian Nation, your great grandchildren,
With weapons in their arms, with your fire in their veins,
“Life in freedom or death!” shout all.

11. Priests, lead with your crucifixes! Because our army is Christian,
The motto is Liberty and its goal is holy,
Better to die in battle, in full glory,
Than to once again be slaves upon our ancient ground!

ru,Russia,https://nationalanthems.info/ru.htm,24,"In late 2000, Russia’s new president Vladimir Putin, made creation of a new anthem for Russia a top priority, since a common complaint was not having words to their current anthem. In early December 2000, Putin presented a bill in the national asssembly to have the melody of the old anthem from the Soviet Union adopted as the new national anthem. The measure passed by a wide margin on December 8, but it was not without controversy, both at the time and since. Many (including former President Yeltsin) did not feel a change was necessary, and the use of the old Soviet anthem could be seen as rejecting post-Communist reforms. Others have expressed concerns that the melody brings back memories of the past of hardships under the Communist regime, especially the crimes that took place under Stalin (who was Soviet leader when the anthem was first introduced).

It was then needed to adopt lyrics for the anthem, as the Communist-era lyrics would be inappropriate. After reviewing thousands of entries, new lyrics by Sergei Vladimirovich Mikhalkov (the same person who wrote the lyrics to the old Soviet anthem) were adopted. The lyrics were also not without controversy as well, the main one being that the words were not well-known (perhaps due to the fact that this was the third set of words used for the melody since its introduction in 1944). Others, particularly the Communist deputies in the legislature, who were in favour of adopting Alexandrov’s melody, objected to the reference to God in the anthem.

Russia is a federal state, and many of the republics (such as Chechnya, Crimea, and Karelia) within Russia have their own anthems for local identity as well.

Special thanks to: Pavel Zinovatny for some of this information, and the English translation of the lyrics.

sm,San Marino,https://nationalanthems.info/sm.htm,13,"Having used a military march by Ulysses Balsimelli with lyrics by Aurelio Muccioli as an unofficial anthem at patriotic events for many years, the request to create an official national anthem fell to Italian violinist and composer Federico Consolo.

sa,Saudi Arabia,https://nationalanthems.info/sa.htm,19,"In 1947, Saudi Arabia lacked an anthem, so, when King Abdulaziz visited Egypt that year, he asked Egyptian composer Abdul Rahman Al-Khateeb to create an anthem and “Aash Al Maleek” was created. The melody, an Arab fanfare style, is similar to those of other Arab states in the area at the time. In 1958, the first set of lyrics were written for the anthem by Mohammed Talat, but weren’t often heard.. In the 1960s and 1970s, a “royal salute” (an even shorter, wordless, “Arab fanfare” style anthem titled “As-salam al malaki as Saud” (Royal Salute of the House of Saud) by Abdul Rahman Al Khateeb) was often presented as the Saudi anthem in recordings, but “Aash Al Maleek” remained the national anthem. In 1984 King Fahd ask poet Ibrahim Al Khafaji to write new lyrics, which are the official lyrics today.

1. Sound, all of you, your Koras,
Beat the drums,
The red Lion has roared,
The Tamer of the bush with one leap has rushed forward
Scattering the gloom.
Light on our terrors,
Light on our hopes.
Arise, brothers, behold Africa united!

CHORUS:
Fibres of my green heart.
Shoulder to shoulder,
O people of Senegal, more than brothers to me, arise!
Unite the sea and the springs,
Unite the steppe and the forest!
Hail, mother Africa,
Hail, mother Africa!

2. Senegal, thou son of the Lion
Arise in the night with great speed,
Restore, oh, restore to us the honour of our ancestors,
Magnificent as ebony and strong as muscles!
We are a straight people-the sword has no fault.

Chorus

3. Senegal, we make your great design our own:
To gather the chicks, sheltering them from kites,
To make from them, from East to West, from North to South,
A people rising as one, in seamless unity,
Yet a people facing all the winds of the earth.

Chorus

4. Senegal, like thee, like all our heroes,
We will be stern without hatred, and with open arms.
The sword we will put peacefully in its sheath,
For work and words will be our weapon.
The Bantu is our brother, the Arab, and the White man too.

Chorus

5. But if the enemy violates our frontiers,
We will all be ready, weapons in our hands;
A people in its faith defying all evil;
Young and old, men and women,
Death, yes! but not dishonour.

rs,Serbia,https://nationalanthems.info/rs.htm,4,"Written in 1872 as part of a play, the popularity of “Bože Pravde” helped to have it officially adopted as the Serbian anthem in 1904, after Serbia became an independent nation in the 1880s. Upon forming the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later to be called Yugoslavia) in 1918, “Bože Pravde” was retained as the anthem of the Serbs within the federation. In fact, the first anthem of the federation, in use until 1945, uses part of “Bože Pravde” in the melody to represent the Serbs of the land.

After World War II, “Bože Pravde” continued to be popular with Serbs, and identified as their anthem. During the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s, Serbian areas that broke away from Croatia (Krajina) and Bosnia (Srpska) also used “Bože Pravde” upon their creation to identify themselves as a Serbian state. In August, 2004, 18 months after Yugoslavia became the new federation of Serbia and Montenegro, “Bože Pravde” was recommended as Serbia’s anthem by the Serb national assembly and was constitutionally adopted upon the dissolution of the union and the regaining of Serbian independence in 2006. Although the anthem has four verses officially, it is usually only the first that is performed.

The original lyrics, present in the former Yugoslav anthem, refer to the Serbian monarchy, which was replaced with a republican-style government in 1945. The current lyrics of the Serbian anthem replace the references to the king with references to the Serbian race. The music of the anthem is by a Slovene, Davorin Jenko.

sl,Sierra Leone,https://nationalanthems.info/sl.htm,1,"Formerly a British colony, this west African nation adopted its national anthem upon independence in 1961. The composer of the music was the first post independence Director of the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service (SLBS) as well as the founder of the Sierra Leone national Dance Troupe, and the lyricist was a professor at Fourah Bay College in Sierra Leone."
sg,Singapore,https://nationalanthems.info/sg.htm,14,"The National Anthem was written in the wake of nationalism during 1956-57. Its composer and author, Zubir Said, had written it on the basis of two words, “Majulah Singapura” or “Onward Singapore”, as a theme for the city council’s official functions. It was first performed in 1958 at the Victoria Theatre. After Singapore attained self government, the song was slightly re-written and was re-introduced in 1959, at the installation of the new head of state and the introduction of the state (later national) flag. The anthem was used as a state song within Malaysia, of which it was a part, and was adopted as a national anthem in 1965 upon independence.

In 2000, the anthem underwent a slight change in that the official arrangement was made more solemn and inspiring. The new version, arranged by Phoon Yew Tien, was officially recorded at the Victoria Concert Hall in November of that year (where the first performance took place 42 years earlier) and was officially unveiled in January, 2001.

Although Singapore has four official languages (Malay, English, Mandarin Chinese, and Tamil), the anthem is only to be sung in the original Malay lyrics, not any translation, as Malay is indigenous to the region and is designated the National Language. (As such, the English translation is presented here, as on several other pages on this site, as a guide for reader comprehension only.) The first four lines of the melody are used as a Presidential Salute.

sk,Slovakia,https://nationalanthems.info/sk.htm,15,"Until the breakup of Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992, the Slovak anthem was used as part of the Czechoslovak anthem. The melody of the anthem, long used as an unofficial anthem, is that of a Slovak folk song entitled “Kopala studienku”. The lyrics were written by a Slovak student who was one of those who joined other students in an exodus from Bratislava to Levoča in 1843 in protest over the firing of a teacher who had Slovak nationalist views; the Tatras, mentioned in the first verse, are a mountain range the students would have passed through on their way from Bratislava to eastern Slovakia, and have been used as a symbol of the nation as a whole.

The song quickly became popular with Slovaks, especially the other students involved in the protest and was used as the Slovak anthem when Czechoslovakia was created. Upon restoration of Slovak independence in 1993, the anthem was made the anthem of Slovakia, slightly altering the version in use until then by replacing the phrase “Zastavme sa” (“Let us pause”), which was a common variant to that point, with “Zastavme ich” (“Let us stop them”), which was determined to be the original words in Matúška’s poem.

za,South Africa,https://nationalanthems.info/za.htm,22,"At the time that South Africa’s multi-racial system of government was adopted, there were two anthems in use among the people, divided by the old racial lines. “N’kosi Sikelel’ iAfrika” (God Bless Africa), written and composed by Enoch Mankayi, was popular with the black population and was used as an anti-Apartheid anthem. The white South Africans had been using “Die Stem van Suid Afrika” (The Call of South Africa) since the 1920s on an unofficial basis, and was made the country’s official anthem in 1957. Even though the latter anthem was seen as too closely tied to the apartheid system by the majority black population, it was decided in the interim to make both anthems the national anthem, “God Bless Africa” was usually played in its entirety followed by the complete “Die Stem”.

In 1997, the two anthems were combined, and the lyrics reflect South Africa’s multi-racial status in that the lyrics employ five of the most popularly spoken of South Africa’s eleven official languages. The lyrics start with a few lines of “Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika” in Xhosa, then Zulu, followed by Sesotho, then a few lines of “Die Stem” in Afrikaans, and finishing the anthem with another few lines from “The Call of South Africa” in English. (The English lines actually do not appear in the official English version of “Die Stem”, but are an abridgement of the last few lines of the first verse, with the words slightly altered to reflect South Africa’s new freedom).

The national anthem of South Africa is unique in a couple of aspects: first of all, as mentioned above, the anthem employs five different languages in the same version of the official lyrics, secondly, by virtue of the fact that it combines two disparate pieces of music, this anthem as well as Italy’s and that of the Philippines are the only ones that end on a different key than they begins with.

At the time that South Africa’s multi-racial system of government was adopted, there were two anthems in use among the people, divided by the old racial lines. “N’kosi Sikelel’ iAfrika” (God Bless Africa), written and composed by Enoch Mankayi, was popular with the black population and was used as an anti-Apartheid anthem. The white South Africans had been using “Die Stem van Suid Afrika” (The Call of South Africa) since the 1920s on an unofficial basis, and was made the country’s official anthem in 1957. Even though the latter anthem was seen as too closely tied to the apartheid system by the majority black population, it was decided in the interim to make both anthems the national anthem, “God Bless Africa” was usually played in its entirety followed by the complete “Die Stem”.
In 1997, the two anthems were combined, and the lyrics reflect South Africa’s multi-racial status in that the lyrics employ five of the most popularly spoken of South Africa’s eleven official languages. The lyrics start with a few lines of “Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika” in Xhosa, then Zulu, followed by Sesotho, then a few lines of “Die Stem” in Afrikaans, and finishing the anthem with another few lines from “The Call of South Africa” in English.

lk,Sri Lanka,https://nationalanthems.info/lk.htm,22,"After independence was granted to Sri Lanka (at the time known as Ceylon) in 1948, the need for a national anthem arose. As a result of a contest, Ananda Samarkone’s contribution, written in Sinhala, was chosen as the new anthem. It was first performed on the fourth anniversary of independence in early 1952.

sz,Eswatini,https://nationalanthems.info/sz.htm,1,"The national anthem, adopted in 1968 on independence (when the nation was known as Swaziland), was composed after extensive ethno-musicological fieldwork in Eswatini. The national anthem was a compromise between Swazi and western styles of music. Swazi music stresses on songs with inticrate polyphony, which is evident in the anthem, making this anthem one of the best examples of the “Eastern folk” style of anthem."
ch,Switzerland,https://nationalanthems.info/ch.htm,5,"In the summer of 1841, Alberik Zwyssig received a piece of mail from Leonhard Widmer, a music publisher, journalist and lyricist from Zurich. The mail contained a patriotic poem that Widmer had written and wanted set to music. Zwyssig chose to use a hymn that he had composed to the psalm “Diligam te Domine” (I will love Thee, O Lord) for an ordination service in 1835 when he was music director at the monastery in Wettingen. On November 22, 1841, Zwyssig rehearsed his “Schweizerpsalm” for the first time with four residents of Zug. The song turned out to be very popular in several Swiss cantons, and numerous attempts were made between 1894 and 1953 to have it declared the Swiss national anthem, but they were consistently turned down by the Swiss government for the reason that a national anthem should not be selected by government decree but by popular opinion.

It was due to the fact that the anthem in use at the time had the same melody as the British anthem, that the Swiss government declared the “Swiss Psalm”, a fully and unmistakably Swiss creation, the provisional Swiss national anthem in 1961, the provisional clause was abandoned in 1975, but without official ratification as the national anthem. A number of other suggestions for a national anthem were made in the years that followed, none of which, however, earned nearly as many votes as the “Swiss Psalm”. Finally, on April 1, 1981, the “Swiss Psalm” was officially declared the Swiss national anthem, “a purely Swiss song, dignified and ceremonial, the kind of national anthem that the majority of our citizens would like to have.”

In 2014, the Société suisse d’utilité publique organized a contest to write new lyrics of the anthem to better reflect modern Swiss society and the Swiss identity. The new lyrics were to take inspiration from the preamble of the Swiss constitution. Despite rounds of voting by the society and the public culminating in the mid 2010s, no change has been announced yet to the anthem.

Switzerland has four official languages, the French, Italian and Romansch versions are official translations of Widmer’s original German lyrics. Some of Switzerland’s cantons (especially those with a recent history of independence outside of Switzerland) have their own anthems, Neuchatel’s cantonal anthem, for example, uses the same melody as the former Swiss anthem, that is “God Save the King (Queen)”.

tw,Taiwan,https://nationalanthems.info/tw.htm,5,"First selected as the anthem for the entirety of China when controlled by the Kuomintang, in 1949 the Kuomintang government was ousted by the Communists, and the government fled to the island of Taiwan and continued their government there, using the same state symbols they had on mainland China.

There is some debate as to whether it should remain the national anthem of Taiwan; some oppose it since it was composed in mainland China, while others because it was (and still remains) the party anthem of just one of Taiwan’s parties. There is a support by some to use the alternate national anthem, “The National Banner Song”, which is used to represent Taiwan at international events like the Olympic Games, but also is used locally as a song played at flag raisings.

The current Taiwanese anthem is presently banned from performance on mainland China and strongly discouraged from being performed in Hong Kong and Macao.

th,Thailand,https://nationalanthems.info/th.htm,24,"The current Thai anthem is actually the latest of many used in the history of the country, although few have enjoyed the longevity the current anthem has.

The notion of a Thai (or Siamese, as Thailand was then known as Siam) anthem was first raised in 1871, when the king, upon visiting the British colony of Singapore, noticed that the British had a national anthem, so one should be made for his country. The first anthem, written by Phraya Sri Sunthornvoharn and entitled “Jom Raj Jong Charoen” (Long Live the King), was derived from an anthem written by two British officers who trained the military band. This anthem proved unpopular, and the second, “Bulan Loy Luen” (Moving Moon), was composed and written by King Rama II.

The third anthem, “Phleng Sansasoen Phra Barami” (A Salute to the Monarch) is still in use today as the royal anthem, but it ceased being the national anthem after the 1932 coup. A short lived song, “Chart Mahachai” (now used as the anthem of the Crown Princess) was the national anthem for a while, but the coup planners wanted to have the composer Peter Feit (known in Thailand as Phra Jenduriyang) compse an anthem for the citizenry in the spirit of “La Marseillaise”. With lyrics by Khun Wichitmatra the new anthem was played for the first time in July, 1932, and the lyrics were subsequently rewritten two years later by Chan Kamwilai.

Thailand (national anthem)

The current Thai anthem is actually the latest of many used in the history of the country, although few have enjoyed the longevity the current anthem has.
The notion of a Thai (or Siamese, as Thailand was then known as Siam) anthem was first raised in 1871, when the king, upon visiting the British colony of Singapore, noticed that the British had a national anthem, so one should be made for his country. The first anthem, written by Phraya Sri Sunthornvoharn and entitled “Jom Raj Jong Charoen” (Long Live the King), was derived from an anthem written by two British officers who trained the military band. This anthem proved unpopular, and the second, “Bulan Loy Luen” (Moving Moon), was composed and written by King Rama II.
The third anthem, “Phleng Sansasoen Phra Barami” (A Salute to the Monarch) is still in use today as the royal anthem, but it ceased being the national anthem after the 1932 coup. A short lived song, “Chart Mahachai” (now used as the anthem of the Crown Princess) was the national anthem for a while, but the coup planners wanted to have the composer Peter Feit (known in Thailand as Phra Jenduriyang) compse an anthem for the citizenry in the spirit of “La Marseillaise”. With lyrics by Khun Wichitmatra the new anthem was played for the first time in July, 1932, and the lyrics were subsequently rewritten two years later by Chan Kamwilai. When the nation’s name was changed to Thailand from Siam in 1939, it was decided new lyrics should be written, and the lyrics by Luang Saranuprapan won the contest and remain the lyrics today. It was also ordered around this time that the anthem must be played every day at 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. when the national flag is also to be raised and lowered. The citizens must stand and show respect for the nation when the anthem is heard. This law remains in force today.

Thailand embraces in its bosom all people of Thai blood.
Every inch of Thailand belongs to the Thais.
It has long maintained its sovereignty,
Because the Thais have always been united.
The Thai people are peace-loving,
But they are no cowards at war.
They shall allow no one to rob them of their independence,
Nor shall they suffer tyranny.
All Thais are ready to give up every drop of blood
For the nation’s safety, freedom and progress. Hurrah!

tl,East Timor,https://nationalanthems.info/tl.htm,16,"On May 20, 2002, this former part of Indonesia also known as East Timor regained the independence it had briefly until Indonesia took over the island following Portuguese withdrawal from the territory in 1975.

It remained the national anthem until the country was invaded by and incorporated into Indonesia a few days later (the Indonesian anthem was then officially used in the territory).

Let us renew the solidarity

tt,Trinidad and Tobago,https://nationalanthems.info/tt.htm,2,"Patrick Castagne, a songwriter from Trinidad, had originally composed an anthem for the West Indies Federation (a proposed union of British-controlled islands in the West Indies, of which Trinidad was one of the largest in terms of area and population, and was also where the capital was located), however, this federation was dissolved in 1962 (partly due to Trinidad and Tobago striving for independence on its own). He reworked the song, titled “A Song for Federation”, by slightly altering the text, and submitted it for the contest for the anthem of Trinidad and Tobago. It was deemed to be the winner, and was played for the first time when independence was granted.

tn,Tunisia,https://nationalanthems.info/tn.htm,18,"The lyrics of the Tunisian anthem were written by an Egyptian in the 1930s. Originally just one verse, another two were added by the Tunisian national poet Aboul-Qacem Echebbi. The music was composed by the same person who wrote the music of the anthems of Libya and the United Arab Emirates. It was first used as an interim anthem after the deposition of the monarchy, between the times when the Bey’s anthem was abolished and the first anthem under the republic was instituted. It was then introduced again in 1987 since the previous anthem was closely tied to the government of Habib Bourguiba, who had been deposed.

ug,Uganda,https://nationalanthems.info/ug.htm,2,"Before independence in 1962, a committee was formed to choose Uganda’s national symbols. A contest was held to determine the national anthem; the criterion for the entrants was that the compositions had to be “short, original, solemn, praising and looking forward to the future.” Despite having recieved several compositions, none were deemed suitable. The head of the committee then asked George Kakoma, a graduate of Trinity College of Music and Durham University in London, to compose an anthem. Kakoma came up with the anthem within a day and it was declared the winner in July of that year, a few months before independence; the short length of the work (it is only nine measures in length, one of the shortest national anthems in the world) was one of the biggest advantages it had in being selected.

ua,Ukraine,https://nationalanthems.info/ua.htm,23,"In 1862, Ukrainian poet and ethnographer Pavlo Chubynskyi wrote a poem “Ще не вмерла Україна” (“Shche ne vmerla Ukrayina”) [Ukraine Is Not Dead Yet] in 1862, which gained a wide popularity among the Ukrainian intelligentsia of the time. It also caught the attention of Mykhailo Verbytskyi, a priest, and was moved to compose music for the poem; it was first performed as a choral work in 1864 in the Ukraine Theatre in Lvov. Russian authorities were concerned about performances of the anthem, and the anthem’s author was expelled from the country “for disturbing the minds” of the public.[1]

Upon the declaration of Ukrainian independence in 1917, a number of patriotic works were used in the capacity of a national anthem, including Chubynskyi’s work, but none of them were officially declared as the national anthem. Several short-lived Ukrainian states in the interwar period used the anthem as theirs, cementing its association with Ukraine. In 1920, Ukraine was made part of the Soviet Union, and “Shche ne vmerla Ukrayina” and other patriotic works were officially discouraged. Upon the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine regained its independence and Chubynskyi’s anthem was the most popular choice already in use as an anthem; when independence was declared no lyrics were officially mandated, the lyrics that were in common use at the time differed somewhat from Chubynskyi’s original poem.

The lyrics were made official in 2003 and changed slightly; the most important change was made to the first line (and title), which were interestingly borrowed from the Polish anthem. In the new version, the case ending of the word “Ukraine” was changed, so that rather than saying “Ukraine hasn’t yet died, nor has her glory or freedom,” it now says that it’s Ukraine’s glory and freedom which haven’t perished. Also, the current version of the anthem is limited to the first verse of Chubynskyi’s poem (with the modification to the first line mentioned above) plus the chorus, which was the first half of Chubynskyi’s original chorus; previously, three verses and a chorus were commonly used.

Upon the declaration of Ukrainian independence in 1917, a number of patriotic works were used in the capacity of a national anthem, including Chubynskyi’s work, but none of them were officially declared as the national anthem. Several short-lived Ukrainian states in the interwar period used the anthem as theirs, cementing its association with Ukraine. In 1920, Ukraine was made part of the Soviet Union, and “Shche ne vmerla Ukrayina” and other patriotic works were officially discouraged. Upon the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine regained its independence and Chubynskyi’s anthem was the most popular choice already in use as an anthem; when independence was declared no lyrics were officially mandated, the lyrics that were in common use at the time differed somewhat from Chubynskyi’s original poem.
The lyrics were made official in 2003 and changed slightly; the most important change was made to the first line (and title), which were interestingly borrowed from the Polish anthem. In the new version, the case ending of the word “Ukraine” was changed, so that rather than saying “Ukraine hasn’t yet died, nor has her glory or freedom,” it now says that it’s Ukraine’s glory and freedom which haven’t perished. Also, the current version of the anthem is limited to the first verse of Chubynskyi’s poem (with the modification to the first line mentioned above) plus the chorus, which was the first half of Chubynskyi’s original chorus; previously, three verses and a chorus were commonly used.

gb,United Kingdom,https://nationalanthems.info/gb.htm,6,"“God Save the King” (or “God Save the Queen”, depending on the gender of the ruling monarch) was first publicly performed in London in 1745 to support King George II after he was defeated in a battle in the Jacobean uprising that started that year. The song was used to boost morale and the forces loyal to George II would go on to defeat the Jacobites the following year. The song came to be referred to as the national anthem from the beginning of the nineteenth century.

The words and tune are anonymous, and may date back to the seventeenth century. There are various claimants to authorship of both the words and tune, the words can be found as early as 1545, when the watchword at night was “God save the King”, the reply was “Long to reign over us.” The authorship of the melody has been claimed by many, including John Bull (the author of the earliest piece of music that resembles the work), Henry Carey, Henry Purcell, and Joseph Haydn (although he probably borrowed the tune upon hearing it in London.)

There is no authorised version of the National Anthem as the words are a matter of tradition. The anthem has also never been officially declared as the national anthem of the country, the royal anthem (as this technically is) is used as the national anthem as a matter of tradition, but this is also due to the unique constitutional situation in the United Kingdom, as the nation doesn’t have a formal constitution. The words used are the same as those sung in 1745; during the periods of a Queen (1837-1901 and 1952-2022), substituting ‘Queen’ for ‘King’ (and female pronouns for male ones) where appropriate. On official (and most other) occassions, the first verse only is sung, on a small number of occassions, the third verse is heard as well; very rarely is the second verse heard due to its militaristic nature. There exist many other verses, some dating as far back as the first three verses, but the first three are what can best be represented as the “standard” British national anthem.

The British tune has since become one of the world’s most recognizable anthems, and has has been used in other countries – as European visitors to Britain in the eighteenth century noticed the advantage of a country possessing such a recognised musical symbol – including Germany, Russia, Switzerland, the United States (where use of the tune continued after independence as the patriotic song “My Country, ‘Tis of Thee” and one of several unofficial anthems before 1931), and even today by Liechtenstein and as the royal anthem of Norway. The song also was an influence on early anthems used in the Kingdom of Hawaii. (One might say that because of this fact, that the United Kingdom was the creator of the concept of a “national anthem”.) Some 140 composers, including Beethoven, Haydn and Brahms, have used the tune in their compositions.

“God Save the King” also serves as the royal anthem for most Commonwealth countries, such as Australia and Canada. (Governors-general of Commonwealth countries usually have bits and pieces of the national anthem strung together played as their anthem.)

us,United States,https://nationalanthems.info/us.htm,4,"During the war of 1812 (on September 14, 1814), poet and lawyer Francis Scott Key wrote a poem entitled “Defense of Fort McHenry”, being inspired by seeing the American flag still flying amidst the battle, of which he was being held as a prisoner of the British because he knew of the plans. Key never meant for it to become a song, or a national anthem, yet after showing the poem to his brother in law Judge Joseph H Nicholson, Nicholson noticed the poem could fit the tune “The Anacreontic Song” (also known as “To Anacraeon in Heaven”), a song originally written for a gentlemen’s social club in London, but gained popularity outside Great Britain, including in the United States, where by this time the tune was familiar to American ears. Key may have had this tune in mind when he wrote the poem; an earlier poem of his called “When the Warrior Returns” was also in the same rhythym, could be set to the same tune, and is of similar subject matter – the last two lines of each stanza of that poem also end with “wave” and “brave”.

The poem spread quickly across the United States, the first printing of the poem in a Baltimore paper suggested the “Anacraeon in Heaven” tune, and it stuck. A Baltimore music store owner first printed the song under the title “The Star Spangled Banner.” It gained in popularity, and was made the official tune to accompany flag raisings by the secretary of the Navy in 1889. In 1916 it was ordered to be played at military and other occasions, and, due to a large public relations effort, it was officially adopted by Congress as the first official national anthem of the United States in 1931. There are four verses to the anthem, but it is the first verse that is almost always sung. (Interestingly, the first verse is a question, only answered by the other three verses).

In addition to countless patriotic songs, there are also state songs for each of the fifty states as well. Also, the song “Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing” is considered an unofficial anthem by the African-American community, and is often used by African-American organizations and at events for the African-American community.

uy,Uruguay,https://nationalanthems.info/uy.htm,20,"After Uruguay’s independence in 1828 without a national anthem, the poet Francisco Esteban Acuña de Figueroa offered to write one for the government, and it was accepted as a draft anthem in 1830 and officially approved by the government three years later. However, like many anthems of the era at the time, it had violent diatribes against Spain (the colonial power over Uruguay) and Portugal and Brazil (Uruguay’s neighbour who annexed the area after a revolt against Spain). The final version debuted in 1845. Acuña de Figueroa’s text had 11 verses, but today only the first verse and the chorus is sung.

The music, typical for a Latin American epic anthem is operatic in nature, reminiscent of works by Italian composers Donizetti, Verdi, Bellini or Rossini, but the music was composed by Francisco José Debali, a Hungarian who had moved to Uruguay in 1838 after having served as a military band master in the Piedmont area of Italy. Acuña de Figueroa’s words were first set to a piece of music by a composer named de Barros, but in 1848 it was set to Debali’s work. The extended grandeur of the music makes it run very long, even though only one verse is performed today; at 105 bars and almost five minutes in length (if the musical introduction is included), Uruguay’s anthem is the longest in the world.

va,Vatican City,https://nationalanthems.info/va.htm,17,"The “Inno e Marcia Pontificale” is the first official anthem of the Vatican after a work known as the “Gran Marcia Trionfale” [Great Triumphal March] by Vittorino Hallmayr, the bandmaster of an Austrian regiment located in Rome, was used on an unofficial basis. The “Inno e Marcia Pontificale” is performed in the presence of: the Pope; one of his special legates; or on occasion of presentation of Credential Letters by a papal nuncio. The music by noted composer Charles-François Gounod was written in 1857 for the jubille anniversary of pope Pius IX. Originally, the anthem had Italian lyrics, Latin lyrics were created later (and slightly modified in 1993) as a way for Catholics around the world to sing it in a common language, and the Italian lyrics are no longer used. The Latin lyrics were by a Catholic priest, who took inspiration from scripture passages about St. Peter (the first Pope in Catholic tradition). According to the Vatican, the “Inno e Marcia Pontificale” is not to be understood as a national anthem, but rather as a hymn that speaks to Roman Catholics worldwide; in practice, however, it serves as the anthem for the Vatican State.

Originally, the anthem had Italian lyrics, Latin lyrics were created later (and slightly modified in 1993) as a way for Catholics around the world to sing it in a common language, and the Italian lyrics are no longer used. The Latin lyrics were by a Catholic priest, who took inspiration from scripture passages about St. Peter (the first Pope in Catholic tradition). According to the Vatican, the “Inno e Marcia Pontificale” is not to be understood as a national anthem, but rather as a hymn that speaks to Roman Catholics worldwide; in practice, however, it serves as the anthem for the Vatican State.

English translation
1. Soldiers of Vietnam, we go forward,
With the one will to save our Fatherland,
Our hurried steps are sounding on the long and arduous road.
Our flag, red with the blood of victory, bears the spirit of our country.
The distant rumbling of the guns passes over the bodies of our foes.
Overcoming all hardships, together we build our resistance bases.
Ceaselessly for the people’s cause let us struggle,
Let us hasten to the battle-field!
Forward! All together advancing!
Our Vietnam is strong, eternal.

2. Soldiers of Vietnam, we go forward!
The gold star of our flag in the wind
Leading our people, our native land, out of misery and suffering.
Let us join our efforts in the fight for the building of a new life.
Let us stand up and break our chains
For too long have we swallowed our hatred.
Let us keep ready for all sacrifices and our life will be radiant.
Ceaselessly for the people’s cause let us struggle,
Let us hasten to the battle-field!
Forward! All together advancing!
Our Vietnam is strong, eternal.

My banner, Oh cloth nailed from every sun
Raise forever on every peak
My nation, give me strength, Oh source of strength

An Arab I am in all my life.
My heart beats in tune with Yemen.
No foreigner shall dominate over Yemen.

zm,Zambia,https://nationalanthems.info/zm.htm,4,"Upon independence in 1964, Zambia adopted the melody of “God Bless Africa” for the melody, yet different lyrics were written to specifically reflect Zambia. “God Bless Africa” is a popular song and anthem in southern Africa, the song was also formerly used by Zimbabwe, Ciskei, and Transkei, and currently by Tanzania and as part of the South African anthem.

In 2005, representatives of the Zambian women’s movement wanted the lyrics to the national anthem changed: “free men” changed to “freely” and “brothers” to “all one”. It was decreed that when the anthem was adopted the masculine gender was used to include females as well, and the anthem was not changed, since the anthem is “composed of historical lyrics that reflect the country’s heritage.”

Special thanks to: Steve Cantwell for correcting some of the information and to Codie Pereira for the music file.

zw,Zimbabwe,https://nationalanthems.info/zw.htm,2,"In 1994, a contest was held for a uniquely Zimbabwean anthem (the anthem then used, “God Bless Africa” was used by at least half a dozen former and current nations and groups in southern Africa). The winning entry was entitled “Kalibusiswe Ilizwe leZimbabwe” in the Ndebele language, “Simudzai Mureza WeZimbabwe” in Shona, and “Blessed Be The Land of Zimbabwe” in English, and had lyrics written for the anthem in all three of the main languages of the country by a leading Zimbabwean poet and academic.
