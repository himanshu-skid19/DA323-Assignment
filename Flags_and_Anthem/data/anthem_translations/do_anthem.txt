National Anthem of Dominican Republic
English Translation
========================================

1. José Reyés was inspired to make this anthem after noticing a published copy of the Argentine anthem. Reyés believed that his country should also have an anthem, so he invited his friend Emilio Prud’homme to write the lines while he composed the music. Soon after Reyés managed to get his anthem published as well; the first performance was on August 17, 1883, it was well-received by the public and soon grew in popularity.

2. A motion in the National Congress was made on June 7, 1897 by deputy Rafael Garcia Martinez to give the song official status, but the president refused to sign the bill into law, possibly because of Prud’homme’s disagreement with President Heureaux’s dictatorial government. It wasn’t until 1934, many years after Heureaux’s death, that President Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina officially adopted the song as the national anthem.

3. The anthem never refers to the nation or its people by the name “Dominican”, but rather uses the poetic term “Quisqueyano” throughout. “Quisqueyano” is a reference to the original native inhabitants’ word for Hispaniola.

4. This is actually the third anthem used in the Dominican Republic. The first, used from 1844 independence to 1885, was known as “Canción Dominicana”, and the second, used after that, did not appear to have a title.

5. Special thanks to: Víctor Alexis Cantillano Oviedo for the sheet music.

English translation
1. Valients of Quisqueya,
Let us sing with strong feeling
And let us show to the world
Our invincible, glorious banner.

49. Hail, O people who, strong and intrepid,
Launched into war and went to death!
Under a warlike menace of death,
You broke your chains of slavery.

50. 2. No country deserves to be free
If it is an indolent and servile slave,
If the call does not grow loud within it,
Tempered by a virile heroism.

51. But the brave and indomitable Quisqueya
Will always hold its head high,
For if it were a thousand times enslaved,
It would a thousand times regain liberty.

52. 3. If it will be exposed to ruse and deceit
Unto contempt of a real imposer,
On to Las Carreras! Beler! …it were places
Where the traces of glory are found.

53. Where on the top of the heroic bastion,
The word of the libarated became flesh,
Where the genius of Sánchez and Duarte
Taught to be free or to die.

54. 4. And if an unattended leader the splendor
Of these glorious events could ignore,
One has seen in Capotillo in the war
The flag of fire wave.

55. And the fire that lets the proud lion
Of Castilla become stupefied,
Removes him from the glorious beaches
Where the crossed banner waves.

56. 5. Compatriots, let us proudly
Show our face, from today prouder than ever;
Quisqueya may be destroyed
But a slave again, never!

57. It is a sanctuary of love that every character
Of the fatherland feels alive!
And it is his coat of arms, the right;
And it is his device: be free or die.

58. 6. Liberty that still rises cool-bloodedly
The victory in her triumphal car.
And the clarion of war re-echoes
Proclaiming his immortal glory.

59. Liberty! That the echo’s touch
While they’re full of noble tension
Our fields of glory repeat
Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!
