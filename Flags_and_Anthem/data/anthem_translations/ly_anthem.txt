National Anthem of Libya
English Translation
========================================

1. Becoming an independent kingdom in late 1951, a competition was held the following year for a national anthem. The winning entry, “Libya, Libya, Libya”, was first performed at the wedding of King Idris in 1955. The composer of the music also wrote the music for the anthems of Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates. The anthem was used until the monarchy was abolished in a coup by Moammar Qadaffi in 1969, when it was replaced with a new anthem.

2. During the 2011 Libyan civil war, the rebel forces against Qadafi’s government used the former anthem from the monarchy period as the Libyan national anthem in the areas that they control. Upon the effective loss of power of the Qadaffi regime, “Libya, Libya, Libya” was restored as the national anthem, with the third verse that mentions the king not being used (it is still sometimes heard, or sometimes it is altered to mention other famous Libyan patriots). (The fourth verse of the original is now the third verse).

CHORUS:
Oh my country! With my struggle and my patience
Drive off enemies and mishaps,
And survive!
Survive all through, we are your ransom
Oh Libya!

52. 1. Oh my country! You are the heritage of grandfathers,
May God cast off any hand that would harm you
Do survive! We are for ever your soldiers,
If you survive we care not who perishes.
To you we give solemn pledges
That we, Oh Libya, will never fail you.
We will never go back to fetters, we have been liberated, and we have freed our home country
Libya, Libya, Libya.

53. Chorus

54. 2. Our grandfathers carried their swords when struggle called on them
Carrying the holy Quran in a hand, and the swords in the other
They fought till they spread religion, peace and prosperity all over the world
Eternity for them
They have built the integrity of our country
Libya, Libya, Libya.

55. Chorus

56. 3. O son of Libya, oh sons of wild lions
We are for glory
And glory is yours
Since we began our struggle, all people were with us
May god protect our independence
Seek the ultimate heights
And be ready for the struggle, our youth
Life is a war for the glory of our home land
Libya, Libya, Libya.
