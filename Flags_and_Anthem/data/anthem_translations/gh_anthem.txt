National Anthem of Ghana
English Translation
========================================

1. The original words to this anthem, adopted upon independence in 1957 and written by the composer Philip Gbeho, were changed upon the declaration of a republic in 1960, and when the government was overthrown six years later, the current lyrics were adopted after a contest was held for new lyrics.

2. Special thanks to: Reinhard Popp for the former lyrics.
