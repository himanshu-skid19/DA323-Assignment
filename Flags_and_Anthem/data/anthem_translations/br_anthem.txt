National Anthem of Brazil
English Translation
========================================

1. Brazil’s anthem was first performed in 1831, shortly after Brazil’s first emperor abdicated. During the imperial period (1822-1889) and for the first few years of the republican period thereafter, the anthem was performed without words, no suitable words having been popular with the people. After becoming a republic in 1889, it was often suggested among the republican groups in the country that a new anthem should be adopted, as the current anthem was used during the imperial era. A new anthem was adopted that year, but was not well-recieved by the population, and the anthem of the Empire was declared official on January 20, 1890. The anthem was still without official words, and each state started adopting their own words to the anthem. In 1906, it was brought forward that lyrics for the anthem should be written, and in 1909 a poem by Joaquim Osório Duque Estrada was composed. However it wasn’t until 1922, for the 100th anniversary of independence, that Osório Duque Estrada’s poem was adopted, with several changes to the text.

2. Brazil, like many other “federalist” nations, have states that have their own anthems as well.

1. The Ypiranga’s placid banks heard
The resounding shouting of a heroic people.
And the sun of freedom, in bright rays,
Shone at this moment in the homeland’s skies.
As the promise of this equality
Was secured by our strong arms,
In your bosom, O Freedom,
We are ready to die.

45. O beloved, idolized homeland, hail, hail!
Brazil, a vivid dream, a lively ray
Of love and hope settles on the earth,
As in your beautiful sky, smiling and limpid,
The image of the Southern Cross shines resplendent.
A giant by nature, you are beautiful,
Strong, an intrepid colossus,
And your future mirrors this grandeur.

46. CHORUS:
O land we adore, among a thousand others
You are the beloved one.
You are the gentle mother of the sons of this land,
Beloved homeland, Brazil!

47. 2. Eternally laid in a splendid cradle,
To the sound of the sea and the light from the depths of the sky,
Brazil, you gleam, fleuron of the Americas,
Illuminated by the sun of the New World.
Your smiling, lovely fields have more flowers
Than the most attractive land elsewhere,
Our forests have more life,
Our life in your bosom more love.

48. O beloved, idolized homeland, hail, hail!
Brazil, may you have as eternal symbol
The starry banner you display,
And may the green laurel of this pennant speak
Of peace in the future and glory in the past.
But if you raise a strong cudgel in the name of justice,
You will see that a son of yours does not run from a fight,
Nor does one who adores you fear death.
