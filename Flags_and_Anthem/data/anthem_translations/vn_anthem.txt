National Anthem of Vietnam
English Translation
========================================

1. Văn Cao, a noted Vietnamese writer and composer, composed “Tiến quân ca” in 1944 while working for an independentist group. It was published in a newspaper and was well-recieved by the citizens, and was sung often during demonstrations and meetings of the revolutionary council. The provisional government adopted it as the anthem in 1945, becoming the anthem of North Vietnam. In 1976, when unification with South Vietnam occured, “Tiến quân ca” was adopted as the anthem for the entire nation.

1. Soldiers of Vietnam, we go forward,
With the one will to save our Fatherland,
Our hurried steps are sounding on the long and arduous road.
Our flag, red with the blood of victory, bears the spirit of our country.
The distant rumbling of the guns passes over the bodies of our foes.
Overcoming all hardships, together we build our resistance bases.
Ceaselessly for the people’s cause let us struggle,
Let us hasten to the battle-field!
Forward! All together advancing!
Our Vietnam is strong, eternal.

26. 2. Soldiers of Vietnam, we go forward!
The gold star of our flag in the wind
Leading our people, our native land, out of misery and suffering.
Let us join our efforts in the fight for the building of a new life.
Let us stand up and break our chains
For too long have we swallowed our hatred.
Let us keep ready for all sacrifices and our life will be radiant.
Ceaselessly for the people’s cause let us struggle,
Let us hasten to the battle-field!
Forward! All together advancing!
Our Vietnam is strong, eternal.
