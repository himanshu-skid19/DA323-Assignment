National Anthem of Turkmenistan
English Translation
========================================

1. After the passing of its first President, the Turkmen anthem had to be re-written to remove references to him in the anthem lyrics. The new lyrics substitutes “the people” instead and the lyrics remain relatively the same. Also, the music has been slightly changed by switching the order of the verse and chorus, in the new version the verse precedes the chorus.

Turkmen lyrics

21. English translation
1. I am ready to give life for native hearth,
The spirit of ancestors descendants are famous for,
My land is sacred, My flag flies in the world
A symbol of the great neutral country flies.

22. CHORUS:
The forever great creation of the people
Native land, sovereign state,
Turkmenistan, light and song of soul,
Long live and prosper for ever and ever!

23. 2. My nation is united and is veins of tribes
Ancestors’ blood, undying flows,
Storms and misfortunes of times are not dreadful for us,
Let us increase fame and honour!
