National Anthem of United Arab Emirates
English Translation
========================================

1. The United Arab Emirates was created in 1971 as a federation of six emirates (a seventh joined the following year) along the Persian Gulf, each of the former emirates nominally independent with their own flag and anthem. For the new federation, a new anthem was adopted without words; in 1986, the minister of education asked Dr. Aref Al Sheikh Abdullah Al Hassan to write lyrics for it in the space of three days. The lyrics were subsequently adopted by the Cabinet[1] [2]. The author of the music also composed the music for the national anthems of Tunisia and Libya.

Live my country, the unity of our Emirates lives
You have lived for a nation
Whose religion is Islam and guide is the Qur’an
I made you stronger in God’s name, oh homeland
My country, My country, My country, My country
God has protected you from the evils of the time
We have sworn to build and work
Work sincerely, work sincerely
As long as we live, we will be sincere
The safety has lasted and the flag has lived oh our Emirates
The symbol of Arabism
We all sacrifice for you, we supply you with our blood
We sacrifice for you with our souls oh homeland
