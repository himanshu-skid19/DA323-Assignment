National Anthem of Fiji
English Translation
========================================

1. The melody of “God Bless Fiji” was adapted from a hymn by Charles Austin Miles entitled “Dwelling in Beulah Land”, which was written in 1911. The lyrics were then written by Michael Francis Alexander Prescott to the tune and won first prize in a nationwide contest before independence in October 1970.

2. The Fijian words, while official, are rarely sung, the English version is much more common. The English and Fijian lyrics are also different in meaning, the lyrics on this page give both the official English lyrics and the English translation of the Fijian lyrics, as well as the Fijian lyrics themselves. The third most common ethnic group on the islands are Indo-Fijians and it was proposed in 2008 that the national anthem be in the three primary languages of the country: English, Fijian, and Hindi.

1. Let us show pride and honour our nation
Where righteous people reside
Where prosperity and fellowship may persevere
Abandon deeds that are immoral

35. CHORUS:
Let Fiji live on
And progress onwards
May our leaders be honourable men
Let them lead our people
To great things
And bring an end to all things immoral

36. 2. The burden of change lie on your shoulders youth of Fiji
Be the strength to cleanse our nation
Be wary and not harbour malice
For we must abandon such sentiments forever
