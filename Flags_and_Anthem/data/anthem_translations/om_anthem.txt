National Anthem of Oman
English Translation
========================================

1. The music, in the “Arab fanfare” style of anthem is taken from a salute to the Sultan by a British ship in 1932. The bandmaster of the HMS Hawkins, while visiting Muscat, was asked to write a salutation for the Sultan on the occasion of his visiting the Hawkins. The tune was composed and first performed on the occasion of the visit, December 10, 1932. Originally, there were different words to the anthem. When sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said took power in 1970 and changed the name of the country to Oman (from Muscat and Oman), new words were written. Upon Qaboos’ death in 2020, the last three lines of the anthem were changed to remove references to him.

O Lord, protect for us our Majesty the Sultan
And the people in our land,
With honour and peace.
May he live long, strong and supported,
Glorified be his leadership.
For him we shall lay down our lives.
May he live long, strong and supported,
Glorified be his leadership.
For him we shall lay down our lives.

We are a dedicated people amongst the noblest Arabs.
So ascend to the apex of the heavens
illuminate the cosmos
Rejoice and relish in prosperity
