National Anthem of Peru
English Translation
========================================

1. The first leader of Peru declared a contest to compose a new national anthem shortly after independence. The winning anthem, entitled “Marcha Nacional” (National March) was accepted immediately as the new national anthem, and was sung for the first time in the Principal Theatre of Lima on the night of 24 September 1821. In the intervening years, there were efforts to alter the lyrics (partly due to the anthem’s anti-Spanish tone) but in 1913 the lyrics were declared to be sacrosanct and not to be rewritten (previous efforts to do so didn’t catch on in popularity anyway). Despite this, the anthem continued to be revised in the ensuing decades. Different words for the first verse, then the second and third verses, were written, with varying degrees of success, during different presidential regimes but after their terms were over, the lyrics reverted back to the original ones.

2. In 2005, it was determined that the first verse, which was most commonly sung at the time, was not written by José de la Torre Ugarte, but it had become part of the popular ethos by this time, as well as being part of the 1913 law regarding the intangibleness of the anthem. It was also determined that the original fifth stanza had been excluded from the anthem, and was reinstated as the sixth stanza, making seven stanzas in all. In 2009, the government declared the last verse to be the official verse to be sung when the anthem is played.

CHORUS:
We are free! May we always be so, may we always be so!
and let the sun rather deny its light
its lights, its lights…the sun!
Before allow us to break the solemn vow
which the motherland elevated to the Eternal
Before allow us to break the solemn vow
which the motherland elevated to the Eternal
Before allow us to break the solemn vow
which the motherland elevated to the Eternal.

64. 1. For a long time the oppressed Peruvian
dragged the ominous chain;
sentenced to a cruel servitude
for a long time, for a long time
for a long time in silence he moaned.
But as soon as the sacred cry
“Liberty!” was heard on its coasts,
he shook off the indolence of slavery,
the humiliated, the humiliated
the humiliated neck he raised
the humiliated neck he raised
the neck he raised!.

65. Chorus

66. 2. Now the roar of rough chains
that we had heard for three centuries of horror
from the free, at the sacred cry
that the world heard astonished, ceased.
Everywhere the inflamed San Martín
“Liberty”, “Liberty” pronounced;
and the Andes, rocking their base,
announced it as well, in unison.

67. Chorus

68. 3. With its influx the peoples woke up,
and like lighting ran the opinion;
from the Isthmus to Tierra del Fuego,
and from Tierra del Fuego to the icy region.
Everyone vowed to break the link
that Nature denied to both worlds,
and break the sceptre that Spain
had reclined, proud, on both.

69. Chorus

70. 4. Lima fulfilled this solemn vow,
and, severe, her anger showed
by throwing out the powerless tyrant,
who had been trying to extend his oppression.
On her endeavor the shackles cracked,
and the furrows that she had repaired in herself
stirred up her hatred and vengeance,
inherited from her Inca and Lord.

71. Chorus

72. 5. Countrymen, may we see her a slave no more.
If for three centuries she moaned, humiliated,
forever may we vow that she be free,
maintaining her own splendor.
Our arms, until today unarmed,
be they always readying the cannon,
that some day the beaches of Iberia
will feel the horror of its roar.

73. Chorus

74. 6. May we arouse the jealousy of Spain
since it has a premonition, with want and furor,
that in a contest of great nations
our country will enter in comparison.
On the list formed by these
we shall fill the line first,
ahead of the ambitious Iberian tyrant,
who devastated all of America.

75. Chorus

76. 7. On its summit may the Andes sustain
the two-color flag or standard,
may it announce to the centuries the effort
that being free gave us forever.
Under its shadow may we live calmly
and, at the sun’s birth over its summits,
may we renew the great oath
we rendered to the God of Jacob.
