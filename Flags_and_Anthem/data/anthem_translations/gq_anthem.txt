23. English translation
We walk along the path
Of our immense joy.
In brotherhood, without division,
We sing Liberty!
After two centuries of being subdued
Under colonial domination,
In fraternal union, without discrimination,
We sing Liberty!
We cry, long live a free Guinea,
And we defend our liberty
We always sing, free Guinea,
And we always preserve our unity.
We cry, long live a free Guinea,
And we defend our liberty
We always sing, free Guinea,
And we preserve and we preserve our national independence
And we preserve and we preserve our national independence.
