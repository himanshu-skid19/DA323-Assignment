National Anthem of Monaco
English Translation
========================================

1. Monaco’s first anthem dates from 1841. The first set of lyrics were used as a marching song for the Guarde Nationale, in which the author, Theophile Bellandro, was a captain. The music by Charles Albrecht along with the lyrics were officially adopted in 1867. In 1931 new lyrics were written in Monegasque, the native language of Monaco. The official lyrics are just one verse, and are not often sung, except at official occassions (the instrumental versions are heard more often). Also, despite French being more prevalently spoken in the principality, and French words exist for the anthem (under the title “Hymne Monégasque”), only the Monegasque lyrics are official.

All the time, over our country,
The same flag has been flying in the wind
All the time, the colours red and white
Have been the symbol of our liberty
Great and small have always respected them.
