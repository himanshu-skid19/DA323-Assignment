    "translation": "The words to “Qassaman” were written in 1956 in Serkaji-Barberousse Prison in Algiers, where the author Moufdi Zakaria was incarcerated by the French colonial forces. The poem was put into music, first by Mohamed Triki in 1956, then by the Egyptian composer Mohamed Fawzi and became the national anthem upon independence on July 5th, 1962. The anti-French sentiments of the third verse result in this verse occasionally being left out of performances, however the verse remains an official part of the text.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

    "translation": "In 1812, Vicente López attended a play about the revolution that brought the country independence two years earlier, the play concluded with an anthem sung by the actors. López was inspired to write a proper anthem for the nation instead of the one presented in the play, and it was approved by the government. The composer of the music used in the play, Blas Parera, was asked to compose the music for the anthem despite Parera’s objections due to the anti-Spanish lyrics and himself being a Spaniard. The stately nature of the music, combined with its long length, make it similar in style to other anthems of the area, a group of anthems I term “Latin American epic anthems”.\n\nThe anthem also has had many titles; originally called the “Anthem of May” by López, it was then christened the “Marcha Patriótica” (Patriotic March) by the government on its adoption on May 11, 1813 (the third anniversary of the revolution) and was later known as “Canción Patriótica Nacional” (National Patriotic Song). An 1847 copy titles it “Himno Nacional Argentino”, which is the name it is known by today.\n\nIn the following years, the anthem underwent many modifications to tone down the militaristic and anti-Spanish nature of the song. In a presidential decree in 1900, it was declared that the first and last verses of the anthem as adopted on March 11, 1813 (rather than the full original nine verses), would be the official anthem, which remains to this day.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

    "translation": "A prolific composer, Scottish-born Peter Dodds McCormick was moved to compose a national anthem for Australia when, having attended a concert of the world’s anthems, there was no anthem for Australia. His original lyrics heavily emphasized Australia’s ties to Britain (as Australia was a British colony at the time). Upon Australia’s inauguration as a separate Commonwealth on January 1, 1901, the song was performed, but the British “God Save the Queen” (as the work was then titled) was still the official anthem of Australia. At this time, the third verse of McCormick’s original work was changed.\n\nWhile “Advance Australia Fair” remained popular with the people in the decades following, no official national anthem other than “God Save the Queen” was declared. In 1974 the Australian Bureau of Statistics conducted a national opinion poll of 60,000 and in 1977 a plebiscite for a national song was conducted. On each occasion, Advance Australia Fair was the preferred option (the other choices were the existing anthem “God Save the Queen” and the popular national songs “Song of Australia” (whose melody was later used for Bougainville‘s anthem) and “Waltzing Matilda”), and it was in consideration of such support that Advance Australia Fair was proclaimed as the national anthem by the Governor-General on 19 April 1984.\n\nIn the late 2010s, there was talk in Australia as to how to change the anthem to recognize the indigenous population of Australia in the anthem, at particular concern was the line “for we are young and free”, which implies a young nation from the perspective of the British colonists that have had a presence in Australia since 1788, and not from the perspective of the indigenous people, which have been in Australia for tens of thousands of years. In late 2020, it was proposed to change the phrase to “for we are one and free” and on January 1, 2021, it was officially changed.\n\nFrom the original five-verse song, only the first and third verses are the official national anthem, with slight changes to make the song more gender-inclusive. The Governor-General of Australia (as the representative of the monarch) is greeted with an abbreviated version of the anthem consisting of the first four bars followed by the last four bars. (The King, as monarch of Australia, continues to use his royal anthem “God Save the King”.)\n\nSpecial thanks to: Leonie Payne and John Farrell for some of this information.",

    "translation": "As an inclusionist measure, a new anthem was adopted for Bosnia and Hercegovina on June 25, 1999. It was originally without words until the lyrics could be written and agreed upon; the music itself was written under the title “Intermecco”, but the anthem is titled “Državna himna Bosne i Hercegovine” (The National Anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina).\n\nNearly ten years later, in February, 2009, lyrics written by the composer of the piece, Dušan Šestić, along with Benjamin Isović, were accepted by a parliamentary commission, yet await official adoption by all levels of government, so the anthem still remains officially without words. While the lyrics don’t mention the different ethnicities or the two administrative areas of Bosnia (the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which uses the national anthem, and Srpska, which uses their own anthem), the anthem concludes with “We go into the future, together”.\n\nThe anthem doesn’t seem to be all that popular in Bosnia, the various nationalities tending to use their own anthems (Serbia‘s or Srpska‘s by the Bosnian Serbs, Croatia‘s by Bosnian Croats, and the former anthem “Jedna si Jedina” by the Bosnian Muslims.)\n\nSpecial thanks to: Miguel Tomàs Gómez Hernández for the sheet music and Ozren Arnautovic for some of this information.",

    "translation": "After winning its independence in 1818 in a bloody war against Spain led by Bernardo O’Higgins, a national anthem was commissioned by the new government. Lyrics written by Argentine poet and freedom fighter Bernardo de Vera y Pintado during the war were adopted. In 1819, once the lyrics were written, a melody was sought for the anthem, during this period the words were briefly used to the melody of the Argentine anthem. On August 20, 1820 (although some sources claim it to be in September, 1819) a work (sheet music with Spanish lyrics) by Manuel Robles Guitérrez was first used. At first the anthem proved to be popular but by 1828 had waned in popularity. The government then requested that Ramon Carnicer i Batlle (a Chilean composer of Catalan descent) compose new music for the anthem, using Bernardo de Vera’s text, which is the music still being used today for the anthem.\n\nOnce the melody was replaced, it was decided to replace the text as well to remove the anti-Spanish sentiments from the lyrics. In 1847, the young poet Eusebio Lillo wrote a new text to Carnicer’s melody, however he kept the chorus from the original anthem. Today, the chorus and fifth verse of Lillo’s poem make up the official national anthem of Chile.\n\nFollowing the coup d’etat by Augusto Pinochet in 1973, the military junta dictated that two verses would be used along with the chorus: the fifth verse was retained, and the third verse, which extolled Chile’s army, was then added as the second official verse. It was a common act of protest by detractors to remain silent during the second verse. When democracy was restored in 1990, the government removed the military verse and restored the anthem as it was before the coup; today, supporters of the past military government still sing the third verse.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Jo Hyo-roe for the sheet music.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

Today, the chorus and fifth verse of Lillo’s poem make up the official national anthem of Chile.\nFollowing the coup d’etat by Augusto Pinochet in 1973, the military junta dictated that two verses would be used along with the chorus: the fifth verse was retained, and the third verse, which extolled Chile’s army, was then added as the second official verse. It was a common act of protest by detractors to remain silent during the second verse. When democracy was restored in 1990, the government removed the military verse and restored the anthem as it was before the coup; today, supporters of the past military government still sing the third verse.\nSpecial thanks to: Jo Hyo-roe for the sheet music.\n\nTitle\n“Himno Nacional de Chile” (Spanish)\n“National Anthem of Chile” (English translation)\n\n“Himno Nacional de Chile” (Spanish)\n“National Anthem of Chile” (English translation)\n\nLyricists\nEusebio Lillo Robles\nBernardo de Vera y Pintado\n\nEusebio Lillo Robles\nBernardo de Vera y Pintado\n\nComposer\nRamon Carnicer i Batlle\n\nRamon Carnicer i Batlle\n\nAdopted\nDecember 23, 1828 (music)\nSeptember 17, 1847 (lyrics)\n\nDecember 23, 1828 (music)\nSeptember 17, 1847 (lyrics)\n\nSheet Music\nMusic only\n\nLyrics\nSpanish lyrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish translation\nChile, your sky is a pure blue,\nPure breezes blow across you,\nAnd your field, embroidered with flowers,\nIs a happy copy of Eden.\nMajestic is the snow-covered mountain\nThat was given to you by the Lord as a bastion,\nThat was given to you by the Lord as a bastion,\nAnd the sea that tranquilly washes your shore\nPromises future splendour for you,\nAnd the sea that tranquilly washes your shore\nPromises future splendour for you.\n\nCHORUS:\nSweet fatherland, accept the vows\nWith which Chile swore at your altars:\nEither you’ll be the tomb of the free\nOr the refuge against oppression\nEither you’ll be the tomb of the free\nOr the refuge against oppression\nEither you’ll be the tomb of the free\nOr the refuge against oppression\nOr the refuge against oppression\nOr the refuge against oppression.\n\nSpanish lyrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish translation\nChile, your sky is a pure blue,\nPure breezes blow across you,\nAnd your field, embroidered with flowers,\nIs a happy copy of Eden.\nMajestic is the snow-covered mountain\nThat was given to you by the Lord as a bastion,\nThat was given to you by the Lord as a bastion,\nAnd the sea that tranquilly washes your shore\nPromises future splendour for you,\nAnd the sea that tranquilly washes your shore\nPromises future splendour for you.\n\nCHORUS:\nSweet fatherland, accept the vows\nWith which Chile swore at your altars:\nEither you’ll be the tomb of the free\nOr the refuge against oppression\nEither you’ll be the tomb of the free\nOr the refuge against oppression\nEither you’ll be the tomb of the free\nOr the refuge against oppression\nOr the refuge against oppression\nOr the refuge against oppression.\n\nChile, your sky is a pure blue,\nPure breezes blow across you,\nAnd your field, embroidered with flowers,\nIs a happy copy of Eden.\nMajestic is the snow-covered mountain\nThat was given to you by the Lord as a bastion,\nThat was given to you by the Lord as a bastion,\nAnd the sea that tranquilly washes your shore\nPromises future splendour for you,\nAnd the sea that tranquilly washes your shore\nPromises future splendour for you.\n\nCHORUS:\nSweet fatherland, accept the vows\nWith which Chile swore at your altars:\nEither you’ll be the tomb of the free\nOr the refuge against oppression\nEither you’ll be the tomb of the free\nOr the refuge against oppression\nEither you’ll be the tomb of the free\nOr the refuge against oppression\nOr the refuge against oppression\nOr the refuge against oppression.\n\nToggle website search",

    "translation": "In 1887, a Bogota comedian named José Domingo Torres, combined his two passions of theatrical music and his love for his country to push for the creation of a national anthem for Colombia. He decided to use as the lyrics of the anthem an inspiration poem written by then President Rafael Núñez commemorating the city of Cartagena, and asked his friend Oreste Sindici, an Italian opera teacher, to compose the music. (One common characteristic of Latin American epic anthems such as Colombia’s is that the music often resembles Italian operas.) The anthem was first performed in November of that year in a music hall in the public school where Sindici taught. The anthem was officially adopted by Congress in 1920, and an official transcription was made in 1946. The anthem is always performed starting with the chorus, then a verse, then the chorus, any one of the eleven verses can be used.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

    "translation": "Cyprus is a bi-national community of Greeks and Turks, where Greeks are the majority and the ruling government. When Cyprus was declared independent from Great Britian in 1960, other national symbols such as the flag were enshrined in the new nation’s constitution, but there was no mention of an anthem. Much debates ensued, and neither community could agree on a national anthem; during foreign state visits, different instrumental marches were used. On November 16, 1966, it was unilaterally decided by the Greek members of government (the Turkish members had already boycotted the government by this point) that the Greek anthem would be used by Cyprus as well. (The Turkish community does not recognize this and instead uses the Turkish anthem for their self-proclaimed nation.)\n\nIn 2004, as a requirement of joining the European Union, a peace plan was proposed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, which included different national symbols, to make them more inclusive of both communities. This also included a wordless anthem that was agreed to by both Turkish and Greek members of the national symbols committee. However, the plan was rejected by the voters and the Greek “Ode to Freedom” remains the Cypriot national anthem.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Theo Stylianides for the sheet music and to Ben Cahoon for some of this information.\n\nSee also: Greece.",

    "translation": "“La Marseillaise” was written and composed by Claude-Joseph Rouget de Lisle, captain in the Engineering corps garrisoned in Strasbourg during the night of 24 to 25 April 1792 at the behest of the city’s mayor, Baron de Dietrich. The song, originally entitled Hymne de Guerre Dédié au Maréchal de Luckner, became known as Chant de Guerre pour l’Armée du Rhin when it was adopted as the marching song of the National Guard of Marseille. The Marseille troops were singing it as they entered Paris on 30 July 1792, and the Parisians dubbed it the Marseillaise. The anthem is probably the first example of the “European march” style of anthem.\n\nDuring the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, “La Marseillaise” was also known as the anthem of the international revolutionary movement. In 1871, it was the anthem of the Paris Commune, and many later anarchists took inspiration from the Commune. After the fall of the Czarist government in Russia, when Communism was just starting to be set up, the melody of “La Marseillaise” was used (with different words) by radical socialists during the era of the Provisional Government, until “The Internationale” gained more popularity, and started to replace “La Marseillaise” as the anthem of leftist revolutionaries.\n\nUnder the First Republic, “La Marseillaise” was one of the civic songs that contributed to the success of the Revolution, and thus was given official status (along with “Chœur de la Liberté”, with words by Voltaire). However, it has not been continuously used since the Revolution; both Empires, the Restoration and the Second Republic passed over it in favour of other songs, with links above. During these times, however, “La Marseillaise” still remained quite popular with the people, especially the republicans, these other anthems were created in an attempt to quell the popularity of “La Marseillaise” (especially during the times of the restored monarchy and empire, when a republican government was against the aims of the current governmental type.)\n\nNot until the Third Republic was the Marseillaise restored to its rank of national anthem on all occasions at which military bands were called upon to play an official air. After the fall of the Third Republic and the occupation of northern France by Germany, the Marseillaise remained the official anthem of both the Vichy government (the Nazi puppet state set up in unoccupied southern France) and the Free France forces, who were against the Vichy government and sought its removal. Both factions also had unofficial anthems in popular use as well, the Vichy government used a song dating from 1847 entitled “Maréchal, nous voilà!” (written and composed by André Montagard and co-composer Charles Courtious), and the Free French “Le Chant des Partisans” composed by Anna Marly (music) and French words by Maurice Druon and Joseph Kessel, customarily sung as the anthem. The Marseillaise was made the official national anthem by the constitutions of the Fourth and Fifth Republics (Article 2 of the Constitution of 4 October 1958). In 1974, President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing had it modified in accordance with earlier scores and slowed the tempo. Since 1981 however, the anthem has once again been performed according to the scores and tempo in use until 1974. While there are seven verses of the song, only the first (and sometimes the sixth and seventh) are sung, along with the chorus.\n\nThe lyrics, speaking of bloody battles and a call for citizens to take up arms, have been debated endlessly whether to alter the words to suit the more peaceful times that France currently enjoys, but the original words, capturing the spirit of the French revolution, remain. This is probably due to the fact that “La Marseillaise” is now inexorably linked to France in the mind of the world.\n\nThe anthem has become one of the most recognized in the world. Tchaikovsky used a piece of it in his “1812 Overture”, which was a chronicle of the war between Russia and France of that year. (The Russian “God Save the Czar” was also used in his work, but, interestingly, neither anthem was used as the national anthem in 1812! They were, however, both used as the respective countries’ national anthems in 1882, which was when the piece was written.) Also, until the adoption of “The Internationale” in Russia around 1918 as the Russian (later Soviet) national anthem, “La Marseillaise” was used by many communist, socialist, and left-leaning groups as an anthem.\n\nSpecial thanks to: “Erwan” and “Daniel” for some of this information.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

While there are seven verses of the song, only the first (and sometimes the sixth and seventh) are sung, along with the chorus.\nThe lyrics, speaking of bloody battles and a call for citizens to take up arms, have been debated endlessly whether to alter the words to suit the more peaceful times that France currently enjoys, but the original words, capturing the spirit of the French revolution, remain. This is probably due to the fact that “La Marseillaise” is now inexorably linked to France in the mind of the world.\nThe anthem has become one of the most recognized in the world. Tchaikovsky used a piece of it in his “1812 Overture”, which was a chronicle of the war between Russia and France of that year. (The Russian “God Save the Czar” was also used in his work, but, interestingly, neither anthem was used as the national anthem in 1812! They were, however, both used as the respective countries’ national anthems in 1882, which was when the piece was written.) Also, until the adoption of “The Internationale” in Russia around 1918 as the Russian (later Soviet) national anthem, “La Marseillaise” was used by many communist, socialist, and left-leaning groups as an anthem.\nSpecial thanks to: “Erwan” and “Daniel” for some of this information.\n\nTitle\n“La Marseillaise” (French)\n“The Song of Marseille” (English translation)\n\n“La Marseillaise” (French)\n“The Song of Marseille” (English translation)\n\nLyricist\nClaude-Joseph Rouget de Lisle\n\nClaude-Joseph Rouget de Lisle\n\nComposer\nClaude-Joseph Rouget de Lisle\n\nAdopted\nJuly 14, 1795\n1799 (replaced)\n1870 (restored)\n\nJuly 14, 1795\n1799 (replaced)\n1870 (restored)\n\nSheet Music\nMusic with French lyrics\n\nMusic with French lyrics\n\nLyrics\nFrench lyrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish translation\n1.

    "translation": "The Greek Anthem is based on the “Hymn to the Freedom”, a large 158 verse poem written by Dionysios Solomos, a distinguished poet from Zakynthos Island. It was inspired by the Greek Revolution of 1821 against the Ottoman Empire. During 1828 Nikolaos Mantzaros composed the music for Solomos’ hymn, one version for the entire poem, and one for just the first two stanzas. Although King Othon (Otto) decorated both of them for their work (1845 and 1849), he did not replace the Royal Anthem of that time with the Solomos/Mantzaros hymn. The royal anthem then in use was a musical derivative from the German one, with a text glorifying Othon and his dynasty. After the overthrow of the dynasty, the new King George I and the Greek establishment decided to look for a clearly Greek work, both with respect to the poetry and the music. The “Hymn to the Freedom” was readily there – extremely popular since the Revolution times, often recited or sung during patriotic meetings and celebrations, and the “Hymn to Freedom” (with Mantzaro’s version for the first two stanzas only) became the national anthem.\n\nThe Greek anthem is also used in Cyprus, which has a substantial Greek community.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Theo Stylianides for the sheet music.",

The words of the national motto, “Ever Conscious of God We Aspire, Build and Advance as One People”, appear in the lyrics. Grenada also still retains the British monarch as their head of state, and thus has the British anthem as their royal anthem.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Jo Hyo-roe for the sheet music and Keith Terrett for the music file.",

    "translation": "In 1963, a delegation from Portugese Guinea (as it was then known, as a Portugese colony) visited China.

    "translation": "Before the current anthem was adopted in 1915, other patriotic songs were unofficially used in Honduras. The current anthem is like many others in Latin America in that the music has an operatic, “epic” feel to it (the composer was born in Germany), and has many verses (in this case, seven), which schoolchildren are expected to memorize in its entirety as a way of learning the country’s history, even though the chorus and the last verse are usually only used on official occasions. As such, it can be classified as a “Latin American epic anthem”.\n\nA unique aspect of the Honduran anthem, however, is that it chronicles the history of the country in its seven verses. The first verse describes the country as Christopher Columbus, the first European to land in Honduras, would have seen it. The second tells of how men “from a country where the sun rises” dreamt of Honduras and go out to seek it. Upon arrival, they find that a flag (Spain’s) has been placed there. The third verse chronicles the native population’s attempted resistance against the Spanish. The fourth speaks of the three centuries under Spanish rule, and how requests for change from the colonies, like Honduras, were unheeded; until one day when news of revolution in Europe reached the Americas. Verse 5 continues this thought, stating how the French revolution was a model for those in Honduras seeking redress from Spain. The next verse (verse six) chronicles the revolutions that occurred in the Spanish colonies in America, as one by one they gained liberation from Spain, including Honduras (as part of the Central American federation, at first.) The final verse is a cry to all Hondurans to defend the nation, even in death if necessary.\n\nThe chorus, sung after each verse and at the start of the anthem (if all verses are sung), or at the start and end of the anthem, with the last verse sandwiched between them (as is performed at official occassions) is a description of the flag and coat of arms of Honduras.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

How often came from the mouths\nOf Osman’s barbarian nation\nOver the corpses of our defeated army\nA victory song!\nHow often did your own son agress\nMy homeland, upon your breast,\nAnd you became because of your own sons\nYour own sons’ funeral urn!\n\n6. The fugitive hid, and towards him\nThe sword reached into his cave\nLooking everywhere he could not find\nHis home in his homeland\nClimbs the mountain, descends the valley\nSadness and despair his companions\nSea of blood beneath his feet\nOcean of flame above.\n\n7.

    "translation": "Much like the United States anthem, the Icelandic national anthem was originally written for a particular occasion and it probably did not occur to either the poet or the composer that the song was destined to become a national anthem.\n\nIn Iceland, nation-wide celebrations were held throughout 1874 to mark the 1000th anniversary of the first Norse settlement of the island. (This is the “Iceland’s thousand years” that are referenced in the anthem.) To mark the occassion, the Bishop of Iceland decreed that church services on August 2 of that year were to be held based on the anniversary, and the text to be presented was Psalm 90. The Rev. Matthías Jochumsson then decided to write a poem based on the Biblical text and the millennial anniversary. While abroad in Edinburgh, Scotland, he met up with Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson, who Jochumsson asked to compose music for his poem.\n\nWhile popular, it was not considered a national anthem. Icelandic independence was still over 40 years away. At the time that “Ó, Guð vors lands” (O, God of Our Land) was written, Icelanders usually sang “Eldgamla Ísafold” by Bjarni Thorarensen as a national anthem. However, that song had anti-Danish (the colonial power) lyrics and was set to the tune of the British national anthem. Therefore “Ó, Guð vors lands” (O, God of Our Land) was played as the national anthem when soverignity was proclaimed in 1918. The anthem has three verses, but the first is usually the one sung.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Josh Lim for some of this information.",

    "translation": "The text of Amhrán na bhFiann, consisting of three stanzas and a chorus, was written in 1907. It was first published in the newspaper, Irish Freedom in 1912. The chorus solely was quietly adopted as the National Anthem in 1926, amid much discussion about the national anthem. The anthem was originally written in English, the later Irish translation by Liam Ó Rinn is much more commonly sung in the country. A section of the National Anthem (consisting of the first four bars followed by the last five) is also the Presidential Salute.\n\nThere has been some criticism about the anthem due to its militant nature and anti-British tone. The words “Fianna Fáil” (Warriors of Ireland) appear in Ó Rinn’s translation, later adopted as the name of an Irish political party, some advocate this be changed to “laochra fáil” (heroes of Ireland) instead. Also, some have argued that the melody is difficult to play, whereas others have pointed out that the whole song has been performed, instead of the chorus (which is the official anthem), or has been played at the wrong speed, both of which have happened at recent Olympic Games.\n\nAn anthem composed by Phillip Coulter called “Irelands Call” is used as a non-sectarian anthem, which is used by athletes from both Ireland and Northern Ireland when competing together as a unified team.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Karen C and Timothy Green for some of this information.",

    "translation": "The origins of “Hatikvah” far predate its use as the Israeli national anthem, in use since soon after its founding as the first Jewish state in modern history. The music is based on a folk song of unknown origin, but appears several times in European folk songs and religious music. The arrangement by Shmuel Cohen from 1888 is probably based on a Romanian folk song he heard during his childhood in Romania, most likely “Carul cu boi” (“The Ox Driven Cart”). The melody also somewhat resembles Smetana’s symphonic poem “Ma Vlast”, which in turn was based on a Swedish version of the Romanian song. The melody is unique in that it is in a minor key, rare among national anthems; however the lyrics (that speak of a “hope”) are of a more uplifting nature.\n\nThe lyrics of the anthem were taken from the first verse and chorus from Naftali Herez Imber’s 1878 poem “Tikavatenu” (Our Hope), which had nine stanzas. At the first Zionist congress of 1897, it was adopted as the anthem of Zionism. The lyrics (primarily of the chorus) underwent a few changes between that time and the creation of the Jewish state of Israel some 50 years later, primarily a change where the song once spoke of a hope to return Zion, it now speaks of a hope to live as a free nation there.\n\nThere has been criticisms of the anthem both from Jews who feel the anthem is too secular, and from non-Jews who feel the anthem focusses too much on the Jewish population.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Naftali Guttman, Justin Mansfield, Adrian Vexler, and Rob Soslow for some of this information.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

    "translation": "Different versions exist as to how of how Goffredo Mameli, a young poet, came to write the anthem in 1847. One reports that Mameli took the anthem to the musician Michele Novaro, a friend, who lived in Turin. Novaro composed the music, and Mameli returned to Genoa where he presented words and music to his friends. Shortly thereafter, “Fratelli D’Italia” (Brothers of Italy, another common name for the anthem) was played for the first time, at a popular assembly. The tune gained popularity throughout the peninsula, in defiance of the Austrian, Bourbon and Papal police.\n\nThe other and equally persuasive story goes that one evening in 1847, in the house of the American consul, the center of discussion was the uprisings of the day. Urged by many of the consul’s guests, Mameli improvised a few lines on the spot and later wrote the rest. A few days later a friend took the poem to Turin and read it aloud at a nobleman’s party. The composer Michele Novaro who was a guest at the same party, tried a few notes on the piano and then, went home to compose the song. The anthem was sung for the first time the next day by a group of political exiles in the Caffè della Lega Italiana of Turin.\n\n“Il Canto degli Italiani” (the official title) was chosen in October, 1946 as the national anthem to replace the royal anthem after becoming a republic, however, it was on a provisional basis, and although the intent was to make it the official anthem, it wasn’t until 2017 that it was codified in law.\n\nThere are slight differences between Mameli’s original poem and how the anthem is sung today. The song is usually sung with the first verse repeated twice then the chorus repeated twice. (If subsequent verses are sung, they are only sung once, this is how the lyrics are presented below). It is also customary to end with “Sì!” (Yes!), perhaps to match the last note of the song.\n\nThere is talk lately of replacing the anthem, firstly because the music is not up to the standards of Italian classical music tradition (ironically, some of Italy’s greatest composers have composed anthems in this tradition, which are used by Central and South American countries, giving birth to the term “Latin American epic anthem”), and also the lyrics refer to specific events that were familiar to the Italians of the time that the anthem was composed, but bear little to no resonance with today’s Italians.

However, “Il Canto degli Italiani” is very recognizable in Italy and would be hard to replace.\nSpecial thanks to: Jamal Dillman-Hasso for a correction to the lyrics.\n\nTitle\n“Il Canto degli Italiani” (Italian)\n“The Song of the Italians” (English translation)\n\n“L’Inno di Mameli” (unofficial title (Italian))\n“Mameli’s Hymn” (unofficial title (English translation))\n\n“Fratelli D’Italia” (unofficial title (Italian))\n“Brothers of Italy” (unofficial title (English translation))\n\n“Il Canto degli Italiani” (Italian)\n“The Song of the Italians” (English translation)\n\n“L’Inno di Mameli” (unofficial title (Italian))\n“Mameli’s Hymn” (unofficial title (English translation))\n\n“Fratelli D’Italia” (unofficial title (Italian))\n“Brothers of Italy” (unofficial title (English translation))\n\nLyricist\nGoffredo Mameli\n\nComposer\nMichele Novaro\n\nAdopted\nOctober 12, 1946 (provisional)\nNovember 17, 2005 (official)\n\nOctober 12, 1946 (provisional)\nNovember 17, 2005 (official)\n\nSheet Music\nMusic with Italian lyrics\n(Page 1, Page 2)\n\nMusic with Italian lyrics\n(Page 1, Page 2)\n\nLyrics\nItalian lyrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish translation\n1.

    "translation": "While in use since the early 1880s as a national anthem on a de facto basis, and the words to the anthem are from the tenth century or earlier, making “Kimigayo” the oldest national anthem in that sense, the government only officially adopted the anthem in 1999. The government presented its interpretation of the meaning of the anthem “Kimigayo” in the Diet during the deliberation of a bill to codify the country’s national flag and anthem. At the plenary session of the House of Representatives of the Diet held on June 29, 1999, Prime Minister Obuchi explained as follows: “Kimi in ‘Kimigayo’, under the current Constitution of Japan, indicates the Emperor, who is the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people, deriving his position from the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power; ‘Kimigayo’ as a whole depicts the state of being of our country, which has the Emperor – deriving his position from the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power – as the symbol of itself and of the unity of the people; and it is appropriate to interpret the words of the anthem as praying for the lasting prosperity and peace of our country.”\n\nIt is not known who first wrote the words of the anthem. They first appeared in the Kokinshu, a collection “of ancient and modern poems” dating from the tenth century. From very early times, the poem was recited to commemorate auspicious occasions and at banquets celebrating important events. The words were often put to music and were also used in fairy tales and other stories and even appeared in the Edo-period popular fiction known as ukiyo-zoshi and in collections of humorous kyoka (mad verse).\n\nWhen the Meiji period began in 1868 and Japan made its start as a modern nation, there was not yet anything called a “national anthem.” In 1869 the British military band instructor John William Fenton, who was then working in Yokohama, learned that Japan lacked a national anthem and told the members of Japan’s military band about the British national anthem “God Save the King.” Fenton emphasized the necessity of a national anthem and proposed that he would compose the music if someone would provide the words. The band members requested Artillery Captain Oyama Iwao, who was well versed in Japanese and Chinese history and literature, to select appropriate words for such an anthem. Fenton put his own music to the “Kimigayo” words selected by Oyama, and the first “Kimigayo” anthem was the result. The melody was, however, completely different from the one known today. It was performed, with the accompaniment of brass instruments, during an army parade in 1870, but it was later considered to be lacking in solemnity, and it was agreed that a revision was needed. In 1876, Osamu Yusuke, the director of the Naval Band, submitted to the Navy Ministry a proposal for changing the music, and on the basis of his proposal it was decided that the new melody should reflect the style used in musical chants performed at the imperial court. In July 1880, four persons were named to a committee to revise the music. They were Naval Band director Nakamura Yusuke; Army Band director Yotsumoto Yoshitoyo; the court director of gagaku (Japanese court music) performances, Hayashi Hiromori; and a German instructor under contract with the navy, Franz Eckert. Finally a melody produced by Hiromori Hayashi was selected on the basis of the traditional scale used in gagaku. Eckert made a four-part vocal arrangement, and the new national anthem was first performed in the imperial palace on the Meiji Emperor’s birthday, November 3, 1880. This was the beginning of the “Kimigayo” national anthem we know today.\n\nThere has been some opposition lately to the “Kimigayo” both within Japan and in other east Asian countries, for its association with militarism, and for the virtual worship of the emperor in the lyrics.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Sun Shu Zhang, Colin Kirkpatrick, and Zachary Harden for some of this information.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

    "translation": "Kenya’s was the first anthem in Africa to be written by a group commissioned by the government. One of the goals of the group was to incorporate traditional Kenyan music in the anthem, the resulting anthem, therefore, has a very African feel to it, a typical example of the “Eastern folk” style of anthem. The melody is actually based on a traditional Kenyan folk song, sung by mothers to their children.\n\nOther criteria the group was charged with to create the anthem was that the tune had to be of the right length and quality, yet possesing the necessary dignity. It also had to lend itself to having words written for it, in both English and Swahili (the official languages of the country). The words had to unify the nation, yet contain the aspirations of the whole country. And the melody had to be able to be performed by a military band, without impairing the original feel of the song. With all those goals in mind, the anthem was ready in time for independence in December, 1963.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Jo Hyo-roe for the sheet music.",

However, the anthem has been kept since it was first adopted.\n\nThe melody was from a Swiss songbook from around 1823. The composer was Ferdinand-Samuel Naegeli (later known as Ferdinand-Samuel Laur). The song that was later used as the Lesothan anthem was titled “Freiheit” (Freedom).

    "translation": "Mali first gained independence in June of 1960 in a federation with Senegal called the Mali Federation. The anthem of the federation, titled “Un Hymn du Mali” (A Song of Mali), used music based on an old folk tune, possibly dating from the Mali Empire of the 13th century. The lyrics for the federation’s anthem, however, were written by a Senegalese man who would go on to be Senegal’s first president when the union dissolved two months later. While the music was written by a Malian and thus adopted by the new nation of Mali, new lyrics were written by a prominent writer and politician, and adopted as the new national anthem two years later. Despite the title commonly being given as the first line of either the chorus or the first verse, the anthem’s official title is “Le Mali”.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

    "translation": "The Dutch national anthem is one of the oldest anthems in existence, the melody was known from before 1572 as a French Huguenot melody titled “Charles”, and the song first appeared in 1626 in a collection of songs assembled by Adriaan Valerius. Philips van Marnix van Sint Aldegonde is widely credited as the author, but as this is very much in dispute, the author is at this point basically unknown. It was not approved as the official national anthem until 1932.\n\n“Het Wilhelmus” has 15 eight-line verses (the first verse, and sometimes the sixth, is most commonly performed). Based on older songs, the Wilhelmus takes the form of an acrostic on the name of William of Orange, the leader of the Dutch revolt against Philip II of Spain.\n\nThe song’s style resembles that of the work of the Rederijkers (“rhetoricians”), sixteenth-century companies of poets. For example, the first letters of the 15 verses spell the name “Willem van Nassov” (in the original orthography, the modern Dutch version has the acrostic spell “Willem van Nazzov”). The text is also thematically symmetrical, in that verses one and 15 resemble on another in meaning, as do verses two and 14, three and 13, etc., until they converge in the eighth verse, the heart of the song: “Oh David, thou soughtest shelter / From King Saul’s tyranny”. The words of the song also highly resemble the poems in the biblical book of Psalms. (The English versification to the right is meant to preserve not only the rhyming scheme and rhythm so that it can be sung to the melody, but also the symmetry of the verses and the acrostic.)\n\nAnother fact about the anthem that is often in dispute is the use of the word “Duitsen” in the second line of the first verse. Often translated as “German”, William’s birthplace indeed lies in modern-day Germany, however, Germany as a nation would not exist for another 300 years (the area still being known as the “Holy Roman Empire”). Only in modern Dutch has “Duits” come to mean “German” in all uses. Others have interpreted the word to mean “of the people”, which of course makes it more inclusive of the Dutch people. This site prefers “Germanic” as the translation; the original lyrics read “van Duytschen bloet”, “Duytschen” referring not to Germany (as it has been established that there was no such nation at the time), but to the lowlands area, which includes the modern-day Netherlands and certain areas of Germany, including where William of Orange was born; the word therefore highlighted William’s local origins. “Germanic” may be the best modern word to cover the original intent and area inferred.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Jan Scotland, Maarten de Zeeuw, Marjan Meijer, and Margriet Verbeek for some of this information.",

    "translation": "The melody of the anthem goes back to the 1700s as a liturgical anthem in Spain. It was brought to Nicaragua shortly before independence in 1821, and was declared as the country’s first official anthem sometime between 1835 and 1837. The wordless melody was used until 1876, when it was replaced with the song “Soldados, ciudadanos” (Soldiers, Citizens). (This anthem may have been wordless until 1889). It was replaced yet again in 1893 after General José Santos Zelaya took over the country; the anthem “Hermosa Soberana” (Beautiful Sovereign) was composed by Zelaya’s son-in-law Alejandro Cousin and was written by either Rubén Darío, Santiago Argüello or Manuel Maldonado. Despite being replaced in 1910 after Zelaya fled the country, the song remains a popular patriotic song in Nicaragua.\n\nAfter decades of political upheaval, which was reflected in the anthem, it was decided to bring stability back to the country by bringing stability to the anthem, so the first anthem, the piece of liturgical music brought over from Spain nearly 90 years previously, was reinstated as the anthem, but had to be recreated from memory as no written record of the music was found. Also, emergency lyrics were written by Marco Antonio Ortega under the title “La Patria Amada” (The Beloved Homeland) until a contest could be held for new lyrics.\n\nThe first priority was to arrange the old music of the national anthem, and Luis Abraham Delgadillo, a Nicaraguan composer who studied in Milan, was chosen to arrange the anthem. In 1918, the key of the anthem was changed to G major and it was made to be played by a band more easily; the new arrangement made the anthem also sound more like other “Latin American epic anthems” also in use by neighbouring countries. A contest was then held for the new lyrics for the anthem. The requirements were that there be words for both parts of the anthem, the only topic would be peace and work (as a contrast to the political upheavals of recent history) and that the words fit the melody.

    "translation": "Nigeria’s anthem the result of a contest held a year before 1960 independence and the winning entry, which focused on unity, was written by a British expatriate[1] and was in use until 1978, when the military dictatorship leading the country changed the anthem and was used during the dictatorship a as a form of protest against the government. The new anthem was retained even after civilian power was returned to the country.\n\nIn 2024 the president decided to reintroduce it as the anthem in May of that year, passing it into law on the 29th of that month[2]. Since this anthem was written by a Briton (the former colonial power), and due to the fact that the government replaced the anthem quicker than the usual legislative process, seemingly at the expense of other matters, there was opposition to this move from members of the public.[3]. Similar to previously, those who support President Tinbu and his decision to change the anthem sing this anthem, while those against the president and his policies, including the change, continue using the old one.\n\nSources:\n[1] Government of Nigeria, “NIGERIA, WE HAIL THEE – The Stirring Saga of our National Anthem(s): Historical Perspective or Voice of a New Dawn?,” Medium, May 30, 2024, https://medium.com/asovilladiaries/nigeria-we-hail-thee-9a0b7af1c3e0.\n[2] Samuel Akpan, “Tinubu signs bill returning old national anthem into law,” The Cable, May 29, 2024, https://www.thecable.ng/breaking-tinubu-signs-bill-to-reintroduce-old-national-anthem-into-law/.\n[3] Mansur Abubakar, “Outrage as Nigeria changes national anthem,” BBC, May 29, 2024, https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gg7z0n4jxo.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Keith Terrett for the music file.",

The original poem had six verses; in 1863 one of the original verses were deleted and three more were added, giving a total of eight verses; the deleted verse was a tribute to King Carl XV, but Bjørnson changed his political views later from monarchism to republicanism, and deleted that verse. Nowadays, the first verse and last two verses are most commonly sung.\n\nThe music was composed by Rikard Nordraak, cousin of Bjørnson and a friend of the famed Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg, in 1864. It was first performed later that year for the 50th anniversary of their constitution, and caught on quickly, overtaking “Sønner af Norges” in popularity. It became a part of the reading books in schools all over the country, and was sung by the children in the children’s parades organized by Bjørnson on every 17th of May.\n\nDespite its widespread use as the national anthem, it has never been officially declared as such. It has been the most popular song presented as the anthem since the early twentieth century, and was performed as the national anthem at the time of Norwegian independence in 1905. Since the summer of 2011, the patriotic song “Mitt lille land” has also been referred to as a “new national anthem”, and has been performed at patriotic events, but has not been used as a national anthem as much as “Ja, vi esker” continues to be.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

    "translation": "The first leader of Peru declared a contest to compose a new national anthem shortly after independence. The winning anthem, entitled “Marcha Nacional” (National March) was accepted immediately as the new national anthem, and was sung for the first time in the Principal Theatre of Lima on the night of 24 September 1821. In the intervening years, there were efforts to alter the lyrics (partly due to the anthem’s anti-Spanish tone) but in 1913 the lyrics were declared to be sacrosanct and not to be rewritten (previous efforts to do so didn’t catch on in popularity anyway). Despite this, the anthem continued to be revised in the ensuing decades. Different words for the first verse, then the second and third verses, were written, with varying degrees of success, during different presidential regimes but after their terms were over, the lyrics reverted back to the original ones.\n\nIn 2005, it was determined that the first verse, which was most commonly sung at the time, was not written by José de la Torre Ugarte, but it had become part of the popular ethos by this time, as well as being part of the 1913 law regarding the intangibleness of the anthem. It was also determined that the original fifth stanza had been excluded from the anthem, and was reinstated as the sixth stanza, making seven stanzas in all. In 2009, the government declared the last verse to be the official verse to be sung when the anthem is played.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

    "translation": "On June 5, 1898, a week before Philippine independence would be declared, Julian Felipe, a local pianist from Kawit, Cavite, arrived at the home of Maximo Inocencio, one of Cavite’s thirteen martyrs during the revolution. Upon his arrival, the leader of the revolution, General Emilio Aguinaldo, asked Felipe to play a march written by a Filipino in Hong Kong. However, Aguinaldo was not satisfied with this march. Recognizing Felipe’s skills, he asked him to compose a more soul-rousing tune that would install courage and patriotism in the hearts of every Filipino.\n\nOn June 11, the day before the declaration of independence, Felipe arrived again and played his tune to the revolutionary leaders. The leaders unanimously approved it as the national hymn. Felipe called his work the “Marcha Filipina Magdalo.” The next day, Felipe’s tune was played during the hoisting of the Philippine flag at the historic window at the Aguinaldo mansion. The march was renamed the “Marcha Nacional Filipina,” and immediately became the National Anthem. However, the anthem still lacked words. The next year, a young soldier named José Palma penned the poem “Filipinas” in Spanish, to match the music of the anthem. It was adopted as the official lyrics.\n\nThe Philippines were now under American rule, and as such, a suitable English translation was to be made of the anthem. The first translation was made by Paz Marquez Benitez of the University of the Philippines. However, the most popular version was written by Mary A. Lane and Senator Camillo Osias, known as the “Philippine Hymn”. On December 5, 1938, the Philippine Congress passed Commonwealth Act 382, which made the anthem’s English words and Felipe’s music official.\n\nA Tagalog (the Filipino language) version of the words started appearing in the 1940’s. In 1948, the Department of Education approved “O Sintang Lupa” (O Beloved Land) as the national anthem’s Filipino words. In 1954, Education Secretary Gregorio Hernandez, Jr., created a committee to revise the words. The new version, entitled “Lupang Hinirang,” was adopted (a minor revision was made in 1962), and is still in use today. Since the passage of the 1998 law about the national symbols (RA 8491), the national anthem can only be sung in Tagalog (the national language) and using only the music composed by Felipe.

    "translation": "The Polish national anthem was written in July 1797 in Reggio near Bolonia by Józef Wybicki, one of the organisers of General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski’s Polish Army in Italy. The theme of the original poem was a novel idea in the era of the nation state (that is, most European nations were made up of eponymous nationalities), that the nation does not need a territory to be a nation, it only needs a group of people. This idea was a timely one, as Poland had only been partitioned out of existence only two years earlier. Several more times in subsequent Polish history would an independent Polish nation appear then disappear from the map, which could explain why the song resonates with Poles even today. The original poem also mentions several Polish war heroes of the time, as well as heroes of past Polish wars; also Napoleon is mentioned, as the commanding officer of Dąbrowski and as an example to be held up.\n\nThe source of the melody is unclear; it is usually ascribed to Michal Kleofas Oginski, but this has not been determined with certainty. It is most likely based on an anonymous fok song, due to the unusual mazurka tempo (which is often played at a faster rate than most anthems); mazurkas originated in Poland and have always been heavily associated with that nation.\n\nIts familiar mazurka melody and its message – a call to join the fight for independence – inspired numerous 19th century patriotic songs and national hymns of the Slavonic nations under foreign rule (some of which would later become Yugoslavia, which could explain the similar melody of the former Yugoslav anthem.) The opening line of the lyrics was also borrowed by Ukraine (which, of course, speaks of the Ukraine not perishing rather than Poland.) In the early years after Poland’s revival in 1918, during the debate about the choice of the national anthem, several candidates were considered. On February 28, 1927 the choice of “Dąbrowski’s Mazurka” as the national anthem was officially announced.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Anthony Zacharzewski and Michal Matyjewicz for some of this information.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

    "translation": "Written during the 1848 revolution by Andrei Mureşianu and set to the music of Anton Pann by Gheorghe Ucenescu and originally titled “Un răsunet” (An Echo), the poem’s theme of revolution, liberty, and patriotism, quickly became popular with Romanians, especially in subsequent national struggles, earning the song the nickname of the “Romanian Marseillaise“. It was first used as a national anthem by the short-lived Moldavian Democratic Republic in 1917-1918 (and was the first anthem in use by independent Moldova from 1991-1994) and was long regarded as an unofficial Romanian anthem. It was heard frequently during the protests against the communist government in late 1989 and was officially confirmed as the national anthem in the spring of 1990. The original work has eleven verses, but only four (verses 1, 2, 4, and 11) are usually performed as the official lyrics (although on special occasions, such as National Anthem Day (July 29, the anniversary of its first performance in 1848), the full lyrics can sometimes be heard).\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

In early December 2000, Putin presented a bill in the national asssembly to have the melody of the old anthem from the Soviet Union adopted as the new national anthem. The measure passed by a wide margin on December 8, but it was not without controversy, both at the time and since. Many (including former President Yeltsin) did not feel a change was necessary, and the use of the old Soviet anthem could be seen as rejecting post-Communist reforms.

In 1958, the first set of lyrics were written for the anthem by Mohammed Talat, but weren’t often heard.. In the 1960s and 1970s, a “royal salute” (an even shorter, wordless, “Arab fanfare” style anthem titled “As-salam al malaki as Saud” (Royal Salute of the House of Saud) by Abdul Rahman Al Khateeb) was often presented as the Saudi anthem in recordings, but “Aash Al Maleek” remained the national anthem.

    "translation": "Written in 1872 as part of a play, the popularity of “Bože Pravde” helped to have it officially adopted as the Serbian anthem in 1904, after Serbia became an independent nation in the 1880s. Upon forming the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later to be called Yugoslavia) in 1918, “Bože Pravde” was retained as the anthem of the Serbs within the federation. In fact, the first anthem of the federation, in use until 1945, uses part of “Bože Pravde” in the melody to represent the Serbs of the land.\n\nAfter World War II, “Bože Pravde” continued to be popular with Serbs, and identified as their anthem. During the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s, Serbian areas that broke away from Croatia (Krajina) and Bosnia (Srpska) also used “Bože Pravde” upon their creation to identify themselves as a Serbian state. In August, 2004, 18 months after Yugoslavia became the new federation of Serbia and Montenegro, “Bože Pravde” was recommended as Serbia’s anthem by the Serb national assembly and was constitutionally adopted upon the dissolution of the union and the regaining of Serbian independence in 2006. Although the anthem has four verses officially, it is usually only the first that is performed.\n\nThe original lyrics, present in the former Yugoslav anthem, refer to the Serbian monarchy, which was replaced with a republican-style government in 1945. The current lyrics of the Serbian anthem replace the references to the king with references to the Serbian race. The music of the anthem is by a Slovene, Davorin Jenko.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Aleksandar Rakovic for some of this information.",

Upon restoration of Slovak independence in 1993, the anthem was made the anthem of Slovakia, slightly altering the version in use until then by replacing the phrase “Zastavme sa” (“Let us pause”), which was a common variant to that point, with “Zastavme ich” (“Let us stop them”), which was determined to be the original words in Matúška’s poem.\n\nTitle\n“Nad Tatrou sa blýska” (Slovak)\n“Storm Over the Tatras” (English translation)\n\n“Nad Tatrou sa blýska” (Slovak)\n“Storm Over the Tatras” (English translation)\n\nLyricist\nJanko Matúška\n\nAdopted\nJanuary 1, 1993\n\nSheet Music\nMusic with Slovak lyrics\n\nMusic with Slovak lyrics\n\nLyrics\nSlovak lyrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish translation\n1.

The white South Africans had been using “Die Stem van Suid Afrika” (The Call of South Africa) since the 1920s on an unofficial basis, and was made the country’s official anthem in 1957.

The lyrics start with a few lines of “Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika” in Xhosa, then Zulu, followed by Sesotho, then a few lines of “Die Stem” in Afrikaans, and finishing the anthem with another few lines from “The Call of South Africa” in English.

    "translation": "In the summer of 1841, Alberik Zwyssig received a piece of mail from Leonhard Widmer, a music publisher, journalist and lyricist from Zurich. The mail contained a patriotic poem that Widmer had written and wanted set to music. Zwyssig chose to use a hymn that he had composed to the psalm “Diligam te Domine” (I will love Thee, O Lord) for an ordination service in 1835 when he was music director at the monastery in Wettingen. On November 22, 1841, Zwyssig rehearsed his “Schweizerpsalm” for the first time with four residents of Zug. The song turned out to be very popular in several Swiss cantons, and numerous attempts were made between 1894 and 1953 to have it declared the Swiss national anthem, but they were consistently turned down by the Swiss government for the reason that a national anthem should not be selected by government decree but by popular opinion.\n\nIt was due to the fact that the anthem in use at the time had the same melody as the British anthem, that the Swiss government declared the “Swiss Psalm”, a fully and unmistakably Swiss creation, the provisional Swiss national anthem in 1961, the provisional clause was abandoned in 1975, but without official ratification as the national anthem. A number of other suggestions for a national anthem were made in the years that followed, none of which, however, earned nearly as many votes as the “Swiss Psalm”. Finally, on April 1, 1981, the “Swiss Psalm” was officially declared the Swiss national anthem, “a purely Swiss song, dignified and ceremonial, the kind of national anthem that the majority of our citizens would like to have.”\n\nIn 2014, the Société suisse d’utilité publique organized a contest to write new lyrics of the anthem to better reflect modern Swiss society and the Swiss identity. The new lyrics were to take inspiration from the preamble of the Swiss constitution. Despite rounds of voting by the society and the public culminating in the mid 2010s, no change has been announced yet to the anthem.\n\nSwitzerland has four official languages, the French, Italian and Romansch versions are official translations of Widmer’s original German lyrics. Some of Switzerland’s cantons (especially those with a recent history of independence outside of Switzerland) have their own anthems, Neuchatel’s cantonal anthem, for example, uses the same melody as the former Swiss anthem, that is “God Save the King (Queen)”.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Jan Scotland for some of this information.",

    "translation": "First selected as the anthem for the entirety of China when controlled by the Kuomintang, in 1949 the Kuomintang government was ousted by the Communists, and the government fled to the island of Taiwan and continued their government there, using the same state symbols they had on mainland China.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether it should remain the national anthem of Taiwan; some oppose it since it was composed in mainland China, while others because it was (and still remains) the party anthem of just one of Taiwan’s parties. There is a support by some to use the alternate national anthem, “The National Banner Song”, which is used to represent Taiwan at international events like the Olympic Games, but also is used locally as a song played at flag raisings.\n\nThe current Taiwanese anthem is presently banned from performance on mainland China and strongly discouraged from being performed in Hong Kong and Macao.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Paul Simon for the sheet music and Keith Terrett for the music file.\n\nSee also: China (1930-1949).",

A short lived song, “Chart Mahachai” (now used as the anthem of the Crown Princess) was the national anthem for a while, but the coup planners wanted to have the composer Peter Feit (known in Thailand as Phra Jenduriyang) compse an anthem for the citizenry in the spirit of “La Marseillaise”. With lyrics by Khun Wichitmatra the new anthem was played for the first time in July, 1932, and the lyrics were subsequently rewritten two years later by Chan Kamwilai. When the nation’s name was changed to Thailand from Siam in 1939, it was decided new lyrics should be written, and the lyrics by Luang Saranuprapan won the contest and remain the lyrics today.

    "translation": "Patrick Castagne, a songwriter from Trinidad, had originally composed an anthem for the West Indies Federation (a proposed union of British-controlled islands in the West Indies, of which Trinidad was one of the largest in terms of area and population, and was also where the capital was located), however, this federation was dissolved in 1962 (partly due to Trinidad and Tobago striving for independence on its own). He reworked the song, titled “A Song for Federation”, by slightly altering the text, and submitted it for the contest for the anthem of Trinidad and Tobago. It was deemed to be the winner, and was played for the first time when independence was granted.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Jo Hyo-roe for the sheet music.",

    "translation": "The lyrics of the Tunisian anthem were written by an Egyptian in the 1930s. Originally just one verse, another two were added by the Tunisian national poet Aboul-Qacem Echebbi. The music was composed by the same person who wrote the music of the anthems of Libya and the United Arab Emirates. It was first used as an interim anthem after the deposition of the monarchy, between the times when the Bey’s anthem was abolished and the first anthem under the republic was instituted. It was then introduced again in 1987 since the previous anthem was closely tied to the government of Habib Bourguiba, who had been deposed.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

A contest was held to determine the national anthem; the criterion for the entrants was that the compositions had to be “short, original, solemn, praising and looking forward to the future.” Despite having recieved several compositions, none were deemed suitable. The head of the committee then asked George Kakoma, a graduate of Trinity College of Music and Durham University in London, to compose an anthem. Kakoma came up with the anthem within a day and it was declared the winner in July of that year, a few months before independence; the short length of the work (it is only nine measures in length, one of the shortest national anthems in the world) was one of the biggest advantages it had in being selected.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Jo Hyo-roe for the sheet music.",

It also caught the attention of Mykhailo Verbytskyi, a priest, and was moved to compose music for the poem; it was first performed as a choral work in 1864 in the Ukraine Theatre in Lvov. Russian authorities were concerned about performances of the anthem, and the anthem’s author was expelled from the country “for disturbing the minds” of the public.[1]\n\nUpon the declaration of Ukrainian independence in 1917, a number of patriotic works were used in the capacity of a national anthem, including Chubynskyi’s work, but none of them were officially declared as the national anthem. Several short-lived Ukrainian states in the interwar period used the anthem as theirs, cementing its association with Ukraine. In 1920, Ukraine was made part of the Soviet Union, and “Shche ne vmerla Ukrayina” and other patriotic works were officially discouraged. Upon the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine regained its independence and Chubynskyi’s anthem was the most popular choice already in use as an anthem; when independence was declared no lyrics were officially mandated, the lyrics that were in common use at the time differed somewhat from Chubynskyi’s original poem.\n\nThe lyrics were made official in 2003 and changed slightly; the most important change was made to the first line (and title), which were interestingly borrowed from the Polish anthem.

    "translation": "“God Save the King” (or “God Save the Queen”, depending on the gender of the ruling monarch) was first publicly performed in London in 1745 to support King George II after he was defeated in a battle in the Jacobean uprising that started that year. The song was used to boost morale and the forces loyal to George II would go on to defeat the Jacobites the following year. The song came to be referred to as the national anthem from the beginning of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe words and tune are anonymous, and may date back to the seventeenth century. There are various claimants to authorship of both the words and tune, the words can be found as early as 1545, when the watchword at night was “God save the King”, the reply was “Long to reign over us.” The authorship of the melody has been claimed by many, including John Bull (the author of the earliest piece of music that resembles the work), Henry Carey, Henry Purcell, and Joseph Haydn (although he probably borrowed the tune upon hearing it in London.)\n\nThere is no authorised version of the National Anthem as the words are a matter of tradition. The anthem has also never been officially declared as the national anthem of the country, the royal anthem (as this technically is) is used as the national anthem as a matter of tradition, but this is also due to the unique constitutional situation in the United Kingdom, as the nation doesn’t have a formal constitution. The words used are the same as those sung in 1745; during the periods of a Queen (1837-1901 and 1952-2022), substituting ‘Queen’ for ‘King’ (and female pronouns for male ones) where appropriate. On official (and most other) occassions, the first verse only is sung, on a small number of occassions, the third verse is heard as well; very rarely is the second verse heard due to its militaristic nature. There exist many other verses, some dating as far back as the first three verses, but the first three are what can best be represented as the “standard” British national anthem.\n\nThe British tune has since become one of the world’s most recognizable anthems, and has has been used in other countries – as European visitors to Britain in the eighteenth century noticed the advantage of a country possessing such a recognised musical symbol – including Germany, Russia, Switzerland, the United States (where use of the tune continued after independence as the patriotic song “My Country, ‘Tis of Thee” and one of several unofficial anthems before 1931), and even today by Liechtenstein and as the royal anthem of Norway. The song also was an influence on early anthems used in the Kingdom of Hawaii. (One might say that because of this fact, that the United Kingdom was the creator of the concept of a “national anthem”.) Some 140 composers, including Beethoven, Haydn and Brahms, have used the tune in their compositions.\n\n“God Save the King” also serves as the royal anthem for most Commonwealth countries, such as Australia and Canada. (Governors-general of Commonwealth countries usually have bits and pieces of the national anthem strung together played as their anthem.)\n\nSpecial thanks to: Artakorn Jarusriwanna for providing me with the sheet music.",

    "translation": "During the war of 1812 (on September 14, 1814), poet and lawyer Francis Scott Key wrote a poem entitled “Defense of Fort McHenry”, being inspired by seeing the American flag still flying amidst the battle, of which he was being held as a prisoner of the British because he knew of the plans. Key never meant for it to become a song, or a national anthem, yet after showing the poem to his brother in law Judge Joseph H Nicholson, Nicholson noticed the poem could fit the tune “The Anacreontic Song” (also known as “To Anacraeon in Heaven”), a song originally written for a gentlemen’s social club in London, but gained popularity outside Great Britain, including in the United States, where by this time the tune was familiar to American ears. Key may have had this tune in mind when he wrote the poem; an earlier poem of his called “When the Warrior Returns” was also in the same rhythym, could be set to the same tune, and is of similar subject matter – the last two lines of each stanza of that poem also end with “wave” and “brave”.\n\nThe poem spread quickly across the United States, the first printing of the poem in a Baltimore paper suggested the “Anacraeon in Heaven” tune, and it stuck. A Baltimore music store owner first printed the song under the title “The Star Spangled Banner.” It gained in popularity, and was made the official tune to accompany flag raisings by the secretary of the Navy in 1889. In 1916 it was ordered to be played at military and other occasions, and, due to a large public relations effort, it was officially adopted by Congress as the first official national anthem of the United States in 1931. There are four verses to the anthem, but it is the first verse that is almost always sung. (Interestingly, the first verse is a question, only answered by the other three verses).\n\nIn addition to countless patriotic songs, there are also state songs for each of the fifty states as well. Also, the song “Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing” is considered an unofficial anthem by the African-American community, and is often used by African-American organizations and at events for the African-American community.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Artakorn Jarusriwanna for providing the sheet music.",

    "translation": "Upon independence in 1964, Zambia adopted the melody of “God Bless Africa” for the melody, yet different lyrics were written to specifically reflect Zambia. “God Bless Africa” is a popular song and anthem in southern Africa, the song was also formerly used by Zimbabwe, Ciskei, and Transkei, and currently by Tanzania and as part of the South African anthem.\n\nIn 2005, representatives of the Zambian women’s movement wanted the lyrics to the national anthem changed: “free men” changed to “freely” and “brothers” to “all one”. It was decreed that when the anthem was adopted the masculine gender was used to include females as well, and the anthem was not changed, since the anthem is “composed of historical lyrics that reflect the country’s heritage.”\n\nSpecial thanks to: Steve Cantwell for correcting some of the information and to Codie Pereira for the music file.\n\nSee also: South Africa (1994-1997).",

    "translation": "In 1994, a contest was held for a uniquely Zimbabwean anthem (the anthem then used, “God Bless Africa” was used by at least half a dozen former and current nations and groups in southern Africa). The winning entry was entitled “Kalibusiswe Ilizwe leZimbabwe” in the Ndebele language, “Simudzai Mureza WeZimbabwe” in Shona, and “Blessed Be The Land of Zimbabwe” in English, and had lyrics written for the anthem in all three of the main languages of the country by a leading Zimbabwean poet and academic.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Jo Hyo-roe for the sheet music and Keith Terrett for the music file.",
