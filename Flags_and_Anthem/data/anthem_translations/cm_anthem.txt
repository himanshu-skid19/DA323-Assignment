National Anthem of Cameroon
English Translation
========================================

1. The anthem of this central African French-English bilingual country was written in 1928, and was used as an unofficial anthem in 1948. Official use came in 1957, when Cameroon became an autonomous republic within France. Finally, the lyrics were changed slightly in 1978, to the current version.

2. Like Canada (another French-English bilingual country), the English and French lyrics are slightly different, on the right is provided the lyrics in each official language, with an English translation of the French lyrics.

3. Special thanks to: Ndiva Mongoh Mafany for the English lyrics and Jo Hyo-roe for the sheet music.

English translation
1. O Cameroon cradle of our ancestors,
Go, stand and jealous of your freedom.
As the sun, your flag should also be proud,
A symbol of ardent faith and unity,
May all your children, North and South
From East to West, are all love!
May they serve you as their sole purpose
To fulfill their duty forever.

31. CHORUS:
Dear Fatherland, dear land,
You are our only true happiness.
Our joy, our life
To you, love and honor.

32. 2. Thou art the grave where our fathers sleep,
The garden that our ancestors have cultivated.
We work to make you prosperous
One day we finally arrived.
Africa’s children be faithful
And still progressing in peace
Hoping that your children
Boundless love you forever.
