National Anthem of Comoros
English Translation
========================================

1. Having achieved independence in 1975, Comoros’ current anthem was adopted in 1978 after a change in power due to a coup. Both the current and former anthems mention the four islands in the Comoros, however, only three are internationally recognized as part of the Comoros, France still retains control over Mayotte (known as Maori (or Maoré) in the anthem).

English translation
The flag is flying,
Announcing complete independence;
The nation rises up
Because of the faith we have
In this our Comoria.
Let us always have devotion
To love our Great Islands.

26. We Comorians are of one blood,
We Comorians are of one faith.
On these Islands we were born,
These Islands brought us up.
May God always help us;
Let us always have the firm resolve
To love our fatherland,
Love our religion and the world.

27. The flag is flying.
From the Sixth of July
The Nation rises up;
Our Islands are lined up.
Maori and Anzuan,
Moheli and Comore,
Let us always have devotion
To love our Great Islands.
