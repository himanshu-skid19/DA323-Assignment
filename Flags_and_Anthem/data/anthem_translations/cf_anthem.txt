National Anthem of Central African Republic
English Translation
========================================

1. The melody of the anthem was composed by the same person who wrote the melody for the Senegalese anthem, a French ethnomusicologist who went to the Central African Republic to study the local music and was asked by Barthélémy Boganda, later the first prime minister of the country who was killed shortly before independence, to put to music the lyrics of the national anthem that he wrote.

29. English translation
Oh! Central Africa, cradle of the Bantu!
Take up again your right to respect, to life!
Long subjugated, long scorned by all,
But, from today, breaking tyranny’s hold.
Through work, order and dignity
You reconquer your rights, your unity,
And to take this new step
The voice of our ancestors call us.

30. CHORUS:
To work! In order and dignity,
in the respect for rights and in unity,
Breaking poverty and tyranny,
Holding high the flag of the Fatherland.

Breaking poverty and tyranny,
Holding high the flag of the Fatherland.
