National Anthem of Zimbabwe
English Translation
========================================

1. In 1994, a contest was held for a uniquely Zimbabwean anthem (the anthem then used, “God Bless Africa” was used by at least half a dozen former and current nations and groups in southern Africa). The winning entry was entitled “Kalibusiswe Ilizwe leZimbabwe” in the Ndebele language, “Simudzai Mureza WeZimbabwe” in Shona, and “Blessed Be The Land of Zimbabwe” in English, and had lyrics written for the anthem in all three of the main languages of the country by a leading Zimbabwean poet and academic.
