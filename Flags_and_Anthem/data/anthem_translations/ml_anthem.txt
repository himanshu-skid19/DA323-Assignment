National Anthem of Mali
English Translation
========================================

1. Mali first gained independence in June of 1960 in a federation with Senegal called the Mali Federation. The anthem of the federation, titled “Un Hymn du Mali” (A Song of Mali), used music based on an old folk tune, possibly dating from the Mali Empire of the 13th century. The lyrics for the federation’s anthem, however, were written by a Senegalese man who would go on to be Senegal’s first president when the union dissolved two months later. While the music was written by a Malian and thus adopted by the new nation of Mali, new lyrics were written by a prominent writer and politician, and adopted as the new national anthem two years later. Despite the title commonly being given as the first line of either the chorus or the first verse, the anthem’s official title is “Le Mali”.

1. At your call, Mali,
So that you may prosper,
Faithful to your destiny,
We shall all be united,
One people, one goal, one faith
For a united Africa.
If the enemy should show himself
Within or without,
On the ramparts,
We are ready to stand and die.

48. CHORUS:
For Africa and for you, Mali,
Our banner shall be liberty.
For Africa and for you, Mali,
Our fight shall be for unity.
Oh, Mali of today,
Oh, Mali of tomorrow,
The fields are flowering with hope
And hearts are thrilling with confidence.

49. 2. Stand up, towns and countryside,
Stand up, women, stand up young and old,
For the Fatherland on the road
Towards a radiant future.
For the sake of our dignity
Let us strengthen our ranks;
For the public well-being
Let us forge the common good.
Together, shoulder to shoulder,
Let us work for happiness.

50. Chorus

51. 3. The road is hard, very hard,
That leads to common happiness.
Courage and devotion,
Constant vigilance,
Courage and devotion,
Constant vigilance,
Truth from olden times,
The truths of every day,
Happiness through effort
Will build the Mali of tomorrow.

52. Chorus

53. 4. Africa is at last arising,
Let us greet this new day.
Let us greet freedom,
Let us march towards unity.
Refound dignity
Supports our struggle.
Faithful to our oath
To make a united Africa,
Together, arise, my brothers,
All to the place where honour calls.
