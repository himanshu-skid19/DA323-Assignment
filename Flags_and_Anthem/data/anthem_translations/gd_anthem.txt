National Anthem of Grenada
English Translation
========================================

1. Before independence, from 1967-1974, Grenada was an associate state of the United Kingdom. Like other associated British states in the West Indies Grenada had its own anthem but unlike the other states, which by and large adopted these anthems as their national anthem upon full independence, Grenada’s “National State Anthem” (with music by Rolstan Percival Jawahir Adams and lyrics by Dr. John George Fletcher) was not used when independence was granted, instead adopting “Hail Grenada” upon independence in 1974. The words of the national motto, “Ever Conscious of God We Aspire, Build and Advance as One People”, appear in the lyrics. Grenada also still retains the British monarch as their head of state, and thus has the British anthem as their royal anthem.
