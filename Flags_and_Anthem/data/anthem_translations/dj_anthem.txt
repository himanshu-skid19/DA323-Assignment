18. English translation
Arise with strength! For we have raised our flag,
The flag which has cost us dear
With extremes of thirst and pain.

19. Our flag, whose colours are the everlasting green of the earth,
The blue of the sky, and white, the colour of peace;
And in the centre the red star of blood.

20. Oh flag of ours, what a glorious sight!
