National Anthem of Morocco
English Translation
========================================

1. The tune of “Hymne Chérifien” was already in use in Morocco when it was a French protectorate, along with a different set of lyrics. Upon independence in 1956, the anthem was confirmed, but the lyrics were not. A new set of lyrics was written in 1970. The “Sharif” of the title is a term given to one who is a protector of the tribe and all its assets.

Fountain of Freedom
Source of Light
Where sovereignty and safety meet,
Safety and sovereignty may you ever combine!
You have lived among nations
With title sublime,
Filling each heart,
Sung by each tongue,
Your champion has risen
And answered your call.
For your soul and your body,
The victory they have conquered.
In my mouth and in my blood
Your breezes have stirred both light and fire.
Up! my brethren,
Strive for the highest.
We call to the world
That we are here ready.
We salute as our emblem
God, Homeland, and King.
