National Anthem of Kuwait
English Translation
========================================

1. Both rarely heard within Kuwait itself, Kuwait’s anthem, like Jordan‘s, has a formal full version of the anthem played on formal occasions, and a short version, which is simply the refrain of the full version. The “national salute” of Kuwait is shorter still, which consists of the first 6 measures of the anthem.

2. Special thanks to: Josh Lim for providing the Arabic text lyrics, and Keith Terrett for the music file of the full version.
