National Anthem of Burkina Faso
English Translation
========================================

1. Also called “Une Seule Nuit” (One Single Night), Burkina Faso’s anthem, entitled “Le Ditanye” according to the constitution, was adopted when the country changed its name from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso in 1984.

2. The author was the president of the country at the time of its renaming. Sankara was an enthusiastic guitarist (he played in a band named “Tout-à-Coup Jazz”) and he was also famous for his charismatic speeches and political poems; therefore it seems to be credible that he really wrote the text (and possibly the music) of the anthem, and his name not just mentioned for propaganda reasons.

1. Against the humiliating bondage of a thousand years
Rapacity came from afar to subjugate them for a hundred years.
Against the cynical malice in the shape
Of neo-colonialism and its petty local servants.
Many gave in and certain others resisted.
But the frustrations, the successes, the sweat, the blood
Have fortified our courageous people and fertilized its heroic struggle.

40. CHORUS:
And one single night has drawn together
The history of an entire people,
And one single night has launched its triumphal march.
Towards the horizon of good fortune.
One single night has brought together our people
With all the peoples of the World,
In the acquisition of liberty and progress.
Motherland or death, we shall conquer.

41. 2. Nourished in the lively source of the Revolution,
The volunteers for liberty and peace
With their nocturnal and beneficial energies of the 4 of August
Had not only hand arms, but also and above all
The flame in their hearts lawfully to free
Faso forever from the fetters of those who
Here and there were polluting the sacred soul of independence and sovereignty.

42. Chorus

43. 3. And seated henceforth in rediscovered dignity,
Love and honour partnered with humanity,
The people of Burkina sing a victory hymn
To the glory of the work of liberation and emancipation.
Down with exploitation of man by man!
Forward for the good of every man
By all men of today and tomorrow, by every man here and always!

44. Chorus

45. 4. Popular revolution our nourishing sap.
Undying motherhood of progress in the face of man.
Eternal hearth of agreed democracy,
Where at last national identity has the right of freedom.
Where injustice has lost its place forever,
And where from the hands of builders of a glorious world
Everywhere the harvests of patriotic vows ripen and suns of boundless joy shine.
