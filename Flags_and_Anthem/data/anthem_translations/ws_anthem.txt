National Anthem of Samoa
English Translation
========================================

1. Since the anthem was adopted upon independence in 1962, there has arisen alternative lyrics for some lines of the anthem that stress Christian imagery and divine protection for the nation. It is unclear when these lyrics were first used, who wrote them, or how official they are, but they have been used with increasing frequency; the nation is almost entirely Christian as well.

Samoa arise
And raise your banner that is your crown.
Samoa arise
And raise your banner that is your crown.
Oh! See and behold the stars on the waving banner;
They are a sign that Samoa is able to lead.
Samoa hold fast your freedom forever.
Do not be afraid; ne’er again your crown shall be taken;
Our treasured precious liberty.
Samoa arise
And wave your banner that is your crown.
