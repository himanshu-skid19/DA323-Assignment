National Anthem of Cape Verde
English Translation
========================================

1. From independence in 1975 to 1996, Cabo Verde (known until late 2013 as Cape Verde) shared the same anthem as Guinea-Bissau, to reflect a proposed merger of these two Portuguese speaking nations. However, when that failed to materialize, Cabo Verde change her flag and anthem to have national symbols more unique to their own nation.

2. Special thanks to: Daniel Picon for providing the lyrics and to Víctor Alexis Cantillano Oviedo for informing us of the sheet music.

English translation
Sing, brother
Sing, my brother
For Freedom is a hymn
And Man a certainty.

25. With dignity, bury the seed
In the dust of the naked island:
In life ís precipice
Hope is as big as the sea
Which embraces us.
Unwavering sentinel of the seas and winds
Between the stars and the Atlantic ocean
Sing the Chant of Freedom.

26. Sing, brother
Sing, my brother
For Freedom is a hymn
And Man a certainty.
