National Anthem of Tunisia
English Translation
========================================

1. The lyrics of the Tunisian anthem were written by an Egyptian in the 1930s. Originally just one verse, another two were added by the Tunisian national poet Aboul-Qacem Echebbi. The music was composed by the same person who wrote the music of the anthems of Libya and the United Arab Emirates. It was first used as an interim anthem after the deposition of the monarchy, between the times when the Bey’s anthem was abolished and the first anthem under the republic was instituted. It was then introduced again in 1987 since the previous anthem was closely tied to the government of Habib Bourguiba, who had been deposed.

CHORUS:
O defenders of the Homeland!
Rally around to the glory of our time!
The blood surges in our veins,
We die for the sake of our land.

52. 1. Let the heavens roar with thunder
Let thunderbolts rain with fire.
Men and youth of Tunisia,
Rise up for her might and glory.
No place for traitors in Tunisia,
Only for those who defend her!
We live and die loyal to Tunisia,
A life of dignity and a death of glory.

53. Chorus

54. 2. As a nation we inherited
Arms like granite towers.
Holding aloft our proud flag flying,
We boast of it, it boasts of us,
Arms that achieve ambitions and glory,
Sure to realize our hopes,
Inflict defeat on foes,
Offer peace to friends.

55. Chorus

56. 3. When the people will to live,
Destiny must surely respond.
Oppression shall then vanish.
Fetters are certain to break.
