National Anthem of Eswatini
English Translation
========================================

The national anthem, adopted in 1968 on independence (when the nation was known as Swaziland), was composed after extensive ethno-musicological fieldwork in Eswatini. The national anthem was a compromise between Swazi and western styles of music. Swazi music stresses on songs with inticrate polyphony, which is evident in the anthem, making this anthem one of the best examples of the “Eastern folk” style of anthem.
