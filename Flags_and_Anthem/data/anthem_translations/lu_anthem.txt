National Anthem of Luxembourg
English Translation
========================================

1. “Ons Heemecht” (originally titled “Ons Hémécht” before Luxembourgish spelling reform in the late twentieth century) was written in 1859 and set to music in 1864. The first performance of the song was on June 5 of that year in Ettelbruck, where the Alzette and Sauer (two rivers mentioned in the opening of the song) meet. It was adopted as the national anthem in 1895, and proclaimed a “national emblem” on June 17, 1993. The official lyrics are verses 1 and 4 of the original work.

English translation
1. Where the Alzette flows through the meadows,
The Sura breaks through the crags.
Where the vine fragrant grows along the Moselle,
The sky promises us wine:
There lies the land for which we willingly
Dare everything down here.
Our homeland which we so deeply
Carry in our hearts.
Our homeland which we so deeply
Carry in our hearts.

25. 2. O Thou above, Whose powerful hand
Leads the nations through the world,
Protect the Luxembourg land
From foreign yoke and threat.
As children Thou already instilled in us all
The spirit of freedom.
Let freedom’s sun, which we have known for so long,
Shine for evermore.
Let freedom’s sun, which we have known for so long,
Shine for evermore.
