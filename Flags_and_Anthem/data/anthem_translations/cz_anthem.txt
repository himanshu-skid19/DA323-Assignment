National Anthem of Czech Republic
English Translation
========================================

1. The music to the anthem was composed by F. Škroup, a main Revivalist composer of Czech music and especially Czech opera. The lyrics were taken from the first stanza of the opera “Fidlovačka”, which was written by Tyl and performed in 1834. The song originally had two verses but when it became the first part of the Czechoslovak state anthem after the country’s liberation in 1918, only one verse was used. Upon dissolution of Czechoslovakia on 1 January 1993, the song became the anthem of the new Czech Republic (now known as Czechia), but only the first verse remains the official anthem.

Where is my home, where is my home?
Water roaring across meadows,
Pines whisper across crags,
In the garden shine the blossoms,
Paradise on earth it is to see!
And that’s the beautiful land,
Czech land, my home.
Czech land, my home.

Where is my home, where is my home?
Water roaring across meadows,
Pines whisper across crags,
In the garden shine the blossoms,
Paradise on earth it is to see!
And that’s the beautiful land,
Czech land, my home.
Czech land, my home.

Water roaring across meadows,
Pines whisper across crags,
In the garden shine the blossoms,
Paradise on earth it is to see!
And that’s the beautiful land,
Czech land, my home.
Czech land, my home.
