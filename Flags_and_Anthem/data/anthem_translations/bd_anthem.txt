National Anthem of Bangladesh
English Translation
========================================

1. “Amar Shonar Bangla” was written in 1906 during the British partitioning of Bengal, a time of great national unrest. The anthem was adopted in 1971 by the provisional government, and officially approved after independence on January 13, 1972. According to the constitution, the first ten lines of the original poem (the portion reproduced on the right) are official. The composer of the words and music for this anthem, a Nobel laureate for literature, also wrote the words and music to India‘s national anthem.

23. English translation
My Bengal of gold, I love you.
Forever your skies, your air set my heart in tune as if it were a flute.
In spring, O mother mine, the fragrance from your mango groves makes me wild with joy,
Ah, what a thrill!
In autumn, O mother mine, in the full blossomed paddy fields I have seen spread all over sweet smiles.
Ah, what beauty, what shades, what an affection, and what tenderness!
What a quilt have you spread at the feet of banyan trees and along the banks of rivers!
O mother mine, words from your lips are like nectar to my ears.
Ah, what a thrill!
If sadness, O mother mine, casts a gloom on your face, my eyes are filled with tears!
