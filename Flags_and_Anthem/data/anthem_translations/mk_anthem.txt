National Anthem of North Macedonia
English Translation
========================================

1. The national anthem of North Macedonia was created in 1943 by Vlado Maleski, a poet from Struga. It was adopted as the anthem of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia while in Yugoslavia after World War II. The song was later selected to be the anthem of the newly independent Republic of Macedonia after its independence in 1991. Upon resolution with Greece (who has neighbouring departments that also contain the name Macedonia), the country’s name was changed in 2019 to North Macedonia, but the lyrics of the anthem still refer to the name Macedonia.
