32. English translation
1. Hail to thee, land of our forefathers,
Thou who made them strong, peaceful and happy,
Cultivating virtue and bravery
For posterity.
Even if tyrants shall come, thy heart yearns towards freedom.
Togo arise! Let us struggle without faltering.
Victory or death, but dignity.
God almighty, Thou alone we exalt
You have made Togo prosper.
People of Togo arise! Let us build the nation.

33. 2. To serve thee in unity
That is the most burning desire of our hearts.
Let us shout aloud our motto
That nothing can tarnish.
We the only builders of thy happiness and of thy future,
Everywhere let us break chains and treachery,
And we swear to thee for ever faith,
And love, service, untiring zeal,
To make thee yet,
Beloved Togo, a golden example for humanity.

34. 3. Hail, hail to the entire Universe
Let us unite our efforts on this immense building site
Whence will be reborn anew
Great Humanity.
Everywhere, instead of misery, let us bring happiness.
Let us chase from the world unruly hatred.
It’s over with slavery and Captivity.
At the star of liberty,
Let us renew the solidarity
Of the Nations in fraternity.
