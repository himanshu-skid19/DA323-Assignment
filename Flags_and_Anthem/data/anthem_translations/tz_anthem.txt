National Anthem of Tanzania
English Translation
========================================

1. Tanzania was the first African nation to use the popular African song “God Bless Africa” as its anthem, in 1961 when it was Tanganyika, and was retained after union with Zanzibar in 1964. It is now also used by South Africa (as part of the current anthem) and Zambia (with different words), and formerly used by Zimbabwe, Ciskei, and Transkei. The version used in Tanzania is in Swahili (the official language of the country) and not in Sontonga’s original lyrics of Xhosa, and was translated by a group of people.
