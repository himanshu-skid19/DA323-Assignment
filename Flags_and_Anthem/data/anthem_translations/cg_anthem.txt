National Anthem of Republic of the Congo
English Translation
========================================

1. Like its neighbour to the east of the same name (see Congo, Dem. Rep. of) the Rep. of Congo (sometimes called Congo (Brazzaville), to distinguish the two nations) re-adopted its original anthem in 1991, which was originally adopted upon independence in 1959 and and was used until Dec. 31, 1969.

2. It is unclear as to who the composer and lyricist are for this anthem, some sources give the authors as Jacques Tondra and Georges (Levent) Kibanghi, with Jean Royer and Joseph Spadilière as the composers, and some list Kibanghi as the sole lyricist and Tondra as the sole composer.

3. Special thanks to: Jean-Francois Blanc for some of this information and to Jaroslaw Wojcik for the sheet music.

1. On this day the sun rises
And our Congo stands resplendent.
A long night is ended,
a great happiness has come.
Let us all, with wild joyfulness, sing
The song of freedom.

34. CHORUS:
Arise, Congolese, proud every man,
Proclaim the unity of our nation.
Let us forget what divides us
And become more united than ever.
Let us live our motto:
Unity, work, progress.
Let us live our motto:
Unity, work, progress.

35. 2. From the forest to the bush,
From the bush to the ocean,
One people, one soul,
One heart, ardent and proud.
Let us all fight, every one of us,
For our black country.

36. Chorus

37. 3. And if we have to die,
What does it really matter? Our children
Everywhere will be able to say how
Triumph comes through battle,
And in the smallest village
Sing beneath our three colours.
