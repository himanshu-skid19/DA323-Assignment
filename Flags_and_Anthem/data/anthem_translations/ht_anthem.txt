1. For our country, for our forefathers,
United let us march, united let us march.
Let there be no traitors in our ranks!
Let us be masters of our soil.
United let us march, united let us march.
For our country, for our forefathers.
Let us march, let us march, let us march united
For our country, for our forefathers.

35. 2. For our forebears, for our country
Let us toil joyfully, let us toil joyfully.
May the fields be fertile
And our souls take courage.
Let us toil joyfully, let us toil joyfully
For our forebears, for our country.
Let us toil, let us toil, let us toil joyfully
For our forebears, for our country.

Oh God of the valiant, Oh God of the valiant!

Under your infinite protection,
Oh God of the valiant, Oh God of the valiant!
For our forebears, for our country.
Oh God, Oh God, Oh God of the valiant!

To die is a fine thing, to die is a fine thing!
Our past cries out to us:
Have a disciplined soul!
To die, to die, to die is a fine thing
For the flag, for our country.
