National Anthem of El Salvador
English Translation
========================================

1. One of the longest national anthems in existence (that is, in the style that it’s usually performed, with the musical introduction, the chorus, the first verse, and the chorus again), the Salvadoran anthem is a typical example of a “Latin American epic anthem”. It was commonly adopted as the National Song on September 15, 1879 but did not have official recognition until December 11, 1953.

2. The anthem was composed by an Italian composer that arrived in the country at the end of the 18th Century as the Director of an opera company and written by General Juan José Cañas, a poet and distinguished military officer, around the year 1856. It was composed at the recommendation of the president Dr. Rafael Zaldívar and was sung for the first time on September 15, 1879 at the National Palace by children and young students from government and private schools of the capital city, and the anthem was very well recieved after the initial performance.

CHORUS:
Let us salute the motherland,
Proud to be called her children.
To her well-being let us swear
Boldly and unceasingly to devote our lives.
Let us salute the motherland,
Proud to be called her children.
To her well-being let us swear
Boldly and unceasingly to devote our lives,
our lives,
our lives,
our lives,
our lives.

47. 1. Of peace enjoyed in perfect happiness,
El Salvador has always nobly dreamed.
To achieve this has been her eternal proposition,
To keep it, her greatest glory.
With inviolable faith, she eagerly follows
The way of progress
In order to fulfil her high destiny
And achieve a happy future.
A stern barrier protects her
Against the clash of vile disloyalty,
Ever since the day when her lofty banner,
In letters of blood, wrote “Freedom”,
Wrote “Freedom”, wrote “Freedom”.

48. Chorus

49. 2. Freedom is her dogma and her guide;
A thousand times she has defended it,
And as many times has she repelled
The hateful power of atrocious tyranny.
Her history has been bloody and sad,
Yet at the same time sublime and brilliant,
A source of legitimate glory
And a great lesson in Spartan pride.
Her innate bravery shall not waver:
In every man there is an immortal hero
Who knows how to maintain the level
Of the proverbial valour of old.
Valour of old, valour of old.

50. Chorus

51. 3. All are self-denying and faithful
To the tradition of warlike ardour
With which they have always reaped fame
By saving the motherland’s honour.
To respect the rights of others
And base her actions on right and justice
Is for her, without infamous intrigue,
The constant and most firm ambition.
And in following this line she persists,
Dedicating her tenacious efforts
In giving hard battle for battle;
Her happiness is found in peace,
Is found in peace, is found in peace.
