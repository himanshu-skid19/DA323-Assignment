National Anthem of Tuvalu
English Translation
========================================

1. Also the national motto, the title of the national anthem “Tuvalu mo te Atua” also appears on the nation’s coat of arms. The lyrics reflect the deep Christian faith of the song’s author and the nation as a whole. Tuvalu also has the British monarch as its head of state, and uses the British “God Save the King” as the royal anthem.
