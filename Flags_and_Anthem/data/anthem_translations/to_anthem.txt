National Anthem of Tonga
English Translation
========================================

1. The anthem was first performed in 1874, though it probably was in use earlier. Officially it is named “Ko e fasi ʻo e tuʻi ʻo e ʻOtu Tonga”, but it is more popularly known as “Fasi Fakafonua”. The anthem references King Tupou; while this was the name of the king of Tonga when the anthem was written, it is also the name of the Tongan Royal House, and therefore of every Tongan ruler since 1874.
