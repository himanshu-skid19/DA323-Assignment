National Anthem of Suriname
English Translation
========================================

1. The anthem has its beginnings in a Sunday School song written in 1893 by Cornelis Atses Hoekstra called “Suriname’s Trotsche Stroomen” (Suriname’s Proud Streams). The song was set to a piece of music by Johannes Corstianus de Puy written in 1876. In 1959, after self-government was granted, the government asked the poet Henry de Ziel (whose pen name was Trefossa) to write lyrics for the anthem in the language popularly spoken in Suriname, Sranan Tongo. He also revised Hoekstra’s lyrics of the second verse to remove the “negative tones” in some lines. Originally the anthem was song with de Ziel’s verse first, but now it is perfomed with Hoekstra’s Dutch verse first and de Ziel’s Sranan lyrics as the second verse.

English translation
1. God be with our Suriname
And elevate our lovely land
However we came together here
We are dedicated to his land
Working we keep in mind
justice and truth make free
All that’s good we should do
That gives value to our land

27. 2. Rise country men, rise
The soil of Suriname is calling you.
Where ever our ancestors came from
We should take care of our country.
We are not afraid to fight
God is our leader
Our whole life until our death,
We will fight for Suriname.
