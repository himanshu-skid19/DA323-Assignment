National Anthem of Uzbekistan
English Translation
========================================

1. When Uzbekistan was a republic of the Soviet Union, it was given its own anthem to use. When independence was proclaimed in 1991, lacking any prior history as a nation or prior national anthem, the old anthem as a Soviet republic, with new lyrics, was adopted a year after independence.

2. Special thanks to: Davie H. Y. Wen for the Uzbek lyrics and Jaroslaw Wojcik for the sheet music.
