National Anthem of Malta
English Translation
========================================

1. First performed February 3, 1923, “L-Innu Malti” became the national anthem in 1945. The author of the anthem’s lyrics, Dun Karm Psaila, (Malta’s national poet), was originally comissioned to write a school hymn to already-existing music, written the year before. He thought of the idea of a national anthem in the form of a prayer, to bind together the political parties and the country with the commonality of prayer.

1. To this sweet land, our mother, to which we owe our name,
Guard her, Lord God, like always you have guarded,
Remember her, which you have clothed with light.

19. 2. Give, Great God, intellect to whom who governs,
Give mercy to the proprietor, and strength to the workman,
To let us serve upright, true and faithful, a united people, Maltese, and in peace.
