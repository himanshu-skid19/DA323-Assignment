National Anthem of Bolivia
English Translation
========================================

1. The composer of the music of this South American Spanish-speaking nation’s anthem (Leopoldo Benedetto Vincenti) is an Italian, which is not that uncommon for “Latin American epic anthems” such as this one, as they often resemble Italian operatic pieces. The author of the lyrics was an ardent patriot, a signer of the Bolivian declaration of Independence and of the first constitution of the country.

1. Bolivians, a most favorable destiny
has at long last crowned our vows and longings;
This land is free, free at last.
Its servile state has now finally ceased.
The martial turmoil of yesterday,
and the horrible clamor of war,
are followed today, in harmonious contrast,
by sweet hymns of peace and unity.
Are followed today, in harmonious contrast,
by sweet hymns of peace and unity.

44. CHORUS:
Let us keep the lofty name of our country
in glorious splendor.
And, on its altars, once more we must swear:
to die before we would live as slaves.
To die before we would live as slaves.
To die before we would live as slaves.

45. 2. Eternal praise to the brave warriors
whose heroic valor and firmness
conquered the freedom and glories that now
a happy Bolivia justly begins to enjoy!
Let their names, preserved forever in marble and bronze,
transmit their glory to remote future ages.
And in resounding song let them repeat their simple call:
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!
And in resounding song let them repeat their simple call:
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

46. Chorus

47. 3. Here has Justice erected its Throne
which vile oppression ignores
and, on its glorious stamp let us rejoice
Freedom, freedom, freedom
This innocent and beautiful land,
which owes its name to Bolívar,
is the happy homeland where mankind
enjoys the benefits of good fortune and peace.
Is the happy homeland where mankind
enjoys the benefits of good fortune and peace.

48. Chorus

49. 4. If a foreigner may, any given day
even attempt to subjugate Bolivia,
let him prepare for a fatal destiny,
which menaces such brave aggressor.
For the sons of the mighty Bolívar
have sworn, thousands upon thousands of times,
to die rather than see the country’s
majestic banner humiliated.
To die rather than see the country’s
majestic banner humiliated.
