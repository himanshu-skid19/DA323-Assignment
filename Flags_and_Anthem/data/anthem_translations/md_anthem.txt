National Anthem of Moldova
English Translation
========================================

1. This neighbour of Romania, with which also shares a language (called “Romanian” in Romania and “Moldovan” in Moldova), and once proposed to reintegrate with that nation, also used the Romanian anthem for the first few years after its 1991 independence from the Soviet Union (which was also its anthem during its short time of independence from 1917-1918). Its new anthem was adopted in 1994. Originally a 12 verse poem, only stanzas 1, 2, 5, 9, and 12 make up the present-day anthem.

24. English translation
1. A treasure is our tongue that surges
From deep shadows of the past,
Chain of precious stones that scattered
All over our ancient land.

25. 2. A burning flame is our tongue
Amidst a people waking
From a deathly sleep, no warning,
Like the brave man of the stories.

26. 5. Our tongue is the greenest leaf
Of the everlasting forests,
Gentle river Nistru’s ripples
Hiding starlight bright and shining.

27. 9. Our tongue is more than holy,
Words of homilies of old
Wept and sung perpetually
In the homesteads of our folks.

28. 12. A treasure will spring up swiftly
From deep shadows of the past,
Chain of precious stones that scattered
All over our ancient land.
