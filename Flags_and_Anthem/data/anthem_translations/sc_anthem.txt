Seychelles Creole lyrics

19. English translation
Seychelles, our homeland.
Where we live in harmony.
Joy, love and peace,
We thank God.
Let us preserve the beauty of our country
And the wealth of our oceans,
Which are both precious heritages
For the future of our children.
Let us stay in unity always
Under the colours of our new flag,
And toghether for eternity
Seychellois, Unite!
