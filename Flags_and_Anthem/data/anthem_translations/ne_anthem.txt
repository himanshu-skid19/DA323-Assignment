National Anthem of Niger
English Translation
========================================

1. Starting in 2019, the Nigerien government expressed interest in replacing the existing national anthem “La Nigerienne” as it was written by citizens of its former colonizer, France, and had lyrics that were deemed racist and of national subservience to France[1]. The new anthem, which was adopted in June, 2023, speaks of national pride and Niger’s place within Africa.

2. A coup a few weeks after the change in anthem replaced the government that introduced the anthem but the anthem change appears to have been retained.

English translation
From the shores of the Niger to the edges of the Ténéré
Brothers and sisters we are
Children of a same fatherland Niger
Fed of the sap of the same ideals
For a Niger of peace, free, strong, and united
For a prosperous Niger, the country of our dreams
For the honor of the fatherland
Let us incarnate the valiance and the perseverance
And all the virtues of our worthy forefathers
Intrepid, determined and proud warriors
Let us defend the homeland at the price of our blood
Let us make Niger the symbol of dignity
The emblem and torch of Africa advancing
For these noble ideals, arise and go forward
Forward for work and forward for the fight
We remain standing
Holding high the flag of our dear country
In the sky of Africa and in the whole universe
To construct together
A world of justice, peace and progress
And to make Niger the pride of Africa
