National Anthem of Nigeria
English Translation
========================================

1. Nigeria’s anthem the result of a contest held a year before 1960 independence and the winning entry, which focused on unity, was written by a British expatriate[1] and was in use until 1978, when the military dictatorship leading the country changed the anthem and was used during the dictatorship a as a form of protest against the government. The new anthem was retained even after civilian power was returned to the country.

2. In 2024 the president decided to reintroduce it as the anthem in May of that year, passing it into law on the 29th of that month[2]. Since this anthem was written by a Briton (the former colonial power), and due to the fact that the government replaced the anthem quicker than the usual legislative process, seemingly at the expense of other matters, there was opposition to this move from members of the public.[3]. Similar to previously, those who support President Tinbu and his decision to change the anthem sing this anthem, while those against the president and his policies, including the change, continue using the old one.
