National Anthem of Hungary
English Translation
========================================

1. Kölcsey’s poem, written in 1823, is set in the 17th century when Hungary was torn into three parts: the independent Hungarian principality in Transylvania, the Turkish occupied central Hungary and the remaining Austrian royal (Habsburg) areas in the north and the west. The subtitle of the poem is ‘A magyar nép zivataros századaiból’ meaning approximately ‘From the Stormy Centuries of the Hungarian People’.

2. The anthem was adopted in 1844, while Hungary was still a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The title of the Hungarian anthem is often (incorrectly) given as the first line of the anthem,”Isten, áldd meg a magyart”, but the title of the poem (“Himnusz”) is the official title of the anthem. While the poem has eight verses, it is almost always just the first verse that is performed, yet the entire poem remains the official anthem.

3. Also widely used in Hungary, but not an official national anthem, is the song “Szózat”, which can be described as the “national song” and is often sung in national celebrations. During the first years of Communist rule, it was debated by the legislators of the time to replace “Himnusz” with “Szózat, as Himnusz is a prayer and Hungary, under Communist rule, was officially atheist, but this was never done. Instead, it was often performed without the words.

English translation
1. O Lord, bless the nation of Hungary
With your grace and bounty
Extend toward it your guarding arm
During strife with its enemies
Long torn by ill fate
Bring upon it a time of relief
This nation has suffered for all sins
Of the past and of the future!

54. 2. You brought our ancestors up
Over the Carpathians’ holy peaks
By You was won a beautiful homeland
For Bendegúz’s sons
And wherever flow the rivers of
The Tisza and the Duna
Árpád our hero’s descendants
Will root and bloom.

55. 3. For us on the plains of the Kuns
You ripened the wheat
In the grape fields of Tokaj
You dripped sweet nectar
Our flag you often planted
On the wild Turk’s earthworks
And under Mátyás’ grave army whimpered
Vienna’s “proud fort.”

56. 4. Hajh, but for our sins
Anger gathered in Your bosom
And You struck with Your lightning
From Your thundering clouds
Now the plundering Mongols’ arrows
You swarmed over us
Then the Turks’ slave yoke
We took upon our shoulders.

57. 5. How often came from the mouths
Of Osman’s barbarian nation
Over the corpses of our defeated army
A victory song!
How often did your own son agress
My homeland, upon your breast,
And you became because of your own sons
Your own sons’ funeral urn!

58. 6. The fugitive hid, and towards him
The sword reached into his cave
Looking everywhere he could not find
His home in his homeland
Climbs the mountain, descends the valley
Sadness and despair his companions
Sea of blood beneath his feet
Ocean of flame above.

59. 7. Castle stood, now a heap of stones
Happiness and joy fluttered,
Groans of death, weeping
Now sound in their place.
And Ah! Freedom does not bloom
From the blood of the dead,
Torturous slavery’s tears fall
From the cold eyes of the orphans!

60. 8. Redeem, O Lord, the Hungarians
Who are tossed by waves of danger
Extend toward it your guarding arm
On the sea of its misery
Long torn by ill fate
Bring upon it a time of relief
They who have suffered for all sins
Of the past and of the future!
