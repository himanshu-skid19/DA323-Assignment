National Anthem of Romania
English Translation
========================================

1. Written during the 1848 revolution by Andrei Mureşianu and set to the music of Anton Pann by Gheorghe Ucenescu and originally titled “Un răsunet” (An Echo), the poem’s theme of revolution, liberty, and patriotism, quickly became popular with Romanians, especially in subsequent national struggles, earning the song the nickname of the “Romanian Marseillaise“. It was first used as a national anthem by the short-lived Moldavian Democratic Republic in 1917-1918 (and was the first anthem in use by independent Moldova from 1991-1994) and was long regarded as an unofficial Romanian anthem. It was heard frequently during the protests against the communist government in late 1989 and was officially confirmed as the national anthem in the spring of 1990. The original work has eleven verses, but only four (verses 1, 2, 4, and 11) are usually performed as the official lyrics (although on special occasions, such as National Anthem Day (July 29, the anniversary of its first performance in 1848), the full lyrics can sometimes be heard).

English translation
1. Wake up, Romanian, from your deadly sleep
Into which you’ve been sunk by the barbaric tyrants
Now, or never, your fate renew,
To which your enemies will bow to.

22. 2. Now or never let’s give proof to the world
That in these veins still flows a Roman blood,
That in our chests we still maintain our pride in a name
The victor in his battles, the name of Trajan!

23. 4. Watch on, shadows of highnesses, Mihai, Stefan, Corvinus,
The Romanian Nation, your great grandchildren,
With weapons in their arms, with your fire in their veins,
“Life in freedom or death!” shout all.

24. 11. Priests, lead with your crucifixes! Because our army is Christian,
The motto is Liberty and its goal is holy,
Better to die in battle, in full glory,
Than to once again be slaves upon our ancient ground!
