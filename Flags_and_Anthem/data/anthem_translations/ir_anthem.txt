National Anthem of Iran
English Translation
========================================

1. In 1990, due to the death of Ayatollah Khomeni, Iran adopted its current anthem after a competition that year. As the Islamic Revolution was ten years ago by this point, the anthem reflects more about the success of the Islamic Republic (the lyrics reference Bahman, which is the month in the Persian calendar of the revolution) and is meant to foster pride in its accomplishments. However, those who protest the government policies during the uprisings in the 2020s do not sing the anthem[1] and instead use the popular protest song Ey Iran, as those who protested the Shah before the Islamic revolution did.

Upwards on the horizon rises the Eastern Sun,
The light in the eyes of those who believe in the right.
Bahman – the brilliance of our Faith.
Your message, O Imam, of independence and freedom
is imprinted on our souls.
O Martyrs! Your cries echo in the ears of history.
Enduring, continuing, eternal,
The Islamic Republic of Iran.
