National Anthem of Saudi Arabia
English Translation
========================================

1. In 1947, Saudi Arabia lacked an anthem, so, when King Abdulaziz visited Egypt that year, he asked Egyptian composer Abdul Rahman Al-Khateeb to create an anthem and “Aash Al Maleek” was created. The melody, an Arab fanfare style, is similar to those of other Arab states in the area at the time. In 1958, the first set of lyrics were written for the anthem by Mohammed Talat, but weren’t often heard.. In the 1960s and 1970s, a “royal salute” (an even shorter, wordless, “Arab fanfare” style anthem titled “As-salam al malaki as Saud” (Royal Salute of the House of Saud) by Abdul Rahman Al Khateeb) was often presented as the Saudi anthem in recordings, but “Aash Al Maleek” remained the national anthem. In 1984 King Fahd ask poet Ibrahim Al Khafaji to write new lyrics, which are the official lyrics today.

Hasten to glory and supremacy!
Glorify the Creator of the heavens
And raise the green, fluttering flag,
Carrying the emblem of Light!
