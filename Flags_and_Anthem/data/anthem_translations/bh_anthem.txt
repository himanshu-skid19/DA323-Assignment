National Anthem of Bahrain
English Translation
========================================

1. Upon independence in 1971, Bahrain adopted the anthem “Bahrainona.” It is in the “Arab fanfare” style of anthem. The original lyrics by Mohamed Sudqi Ayyash were changed in 2002 when the country became a kingdom and the ruler became a king rather than an Emir.
