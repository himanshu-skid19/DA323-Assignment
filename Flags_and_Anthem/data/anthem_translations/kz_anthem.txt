National Anthem of Kazakhstan
English Translation
========================================

1. On January 6, 2006, Kazakhstan replaced the anthem in use since its time as a Soviet republic (having changed the lyrics upon 1992 independence) with “My Kazakhstan”, a patriotic song written in 1958. The president Nursultan Nazarbayev revised the lyrics somewhat, thereby making him a co-author of the anthem.

2. Special thanks to: Pavel Zinovatny for the English translation, and Davie H. Y. Wen for the Kazakh (Cyrillic and Latin scripts) lyrics.

44. 
English translation
1. Sky of golden sun,
Steppe of golden seed,
Legend of courage –
Take a look at my country!

45. From antiquity
Our heroic glory emerged,
They did not give up their pride
My Kazakh people are strong!

46. CHORUS:
My country, my country,
As your flower I will be planted,
As your song I will stream, my country!
My native land – My Kazakhstan!

47. 2. The way was opened to posterity
I have a vast land.
Its unity is proper,
I have an independent country.

48. It welcomed the time
Like an eternal friend,
Our country is happy,
Such is our country.
