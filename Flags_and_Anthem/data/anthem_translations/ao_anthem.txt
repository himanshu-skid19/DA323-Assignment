National Anthem of Angola
English Translation
========================================

1. During Portuguese rule, starting in 1961, Angola had an unofficial local anthem, entitled “Angola é nossa” (“Angola is ours”), used as a march by the Portuguese troops in Angola, it was not performed after independence negotiations were started in 1974, and a different anthem, “Angola Avante” was adopted upon independence from Portugal.

2. There has been a commission appointed to study any possible changes needed in Angola’s national symbols (there are references in the national anthem to important dates and events for the previous sole ruling party, made obsolete after multi-party elections were declared). The anthem may change in the future, watch this page for further information.

The heroes of the Fourth of February.
O Fatherland, we salute your sons
Who died for our Independence.
We honour the past and our history
As by our work we build the New Man.
We honour the past and our history
As by our work we build the New Man.

In solidarity with oppressed peoples.
