National Anthem of Vanuatu
English Translation
========================================

1. Vanuatu gained its independence from both the United Kingdom and France in 1980. (I assume that during the colonial period, both anthems were used, however I do not know how they were performed). Upon independence, the anthem “Yumi, Yumi, Yumi”, written in the native Bislama language (a type of Pigdin English/French hybrid), was chosen as the national anthem.
