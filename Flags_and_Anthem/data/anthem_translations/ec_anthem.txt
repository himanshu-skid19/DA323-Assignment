National Anthem of Ecuador
English Translation
========================================

1. Ecuador’s anthem is another example of a “Latin American epic anthem”. The lyrics were written in 1865 (the author, Juan León Mera, later served as president of the Ecuadoran senate) and set to music the following year. Except in formal occassions (where the second verse is performed, followed by the third verse and the the second verse is repeated), the second verse is the verse that’s sung out of the seven verses of the poem (six of which make up the complete lyrics of the anthem.)

CHORUS:
O homeland, we greet you a thousand times!
Glory be to you, O homeland, glory be to you!
Your breast overflows with joy and peace,
And we see your radiant face shining
More brightly than the sun.

51. 2. The worthy sons of the soil
Which Pichincha on high is adorning,
Always acclaimed you as sovereign lady
And shed their blood for you.
God observed and accepted the sacrifice,
And that blood was the prolific seed
Of other heroes whom the world in astonishment saw
Arising in thousands around you.

52. Chorus

53. 3. For these steel armed heroes
Nothing in the land was invincible
And from the valley to the high Sierra
Could the clamour of the struggle be heard;
After the struggle, victory came flying.
And freedom followed on victory’s heel.
And the toppled lion could be heard,
As it roared in impotence and vanity.

54. Chorus
