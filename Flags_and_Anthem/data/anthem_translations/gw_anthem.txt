National Anthem of Guinea-Bissau
English Translation
========================================

1. In 1963, a delegation from Portugese Guinea (as it was then known, as a Portugese colony) visited China. After hearing a song composed by Xiao He, one of the independentist politicians in attendance, Amilcar Lopes Cabral, said that he would like that composer to compose a similar song to inspire the people of Portugese Guinea to strive for independence. Using African music as his inspiration, Xiao He composed the music, which became the anthem of Guinea-Bissau upon 1974 independence.

2. Since Cabral’s organization included both Portugese Guinea and Cabo Verde, the anthem was also adopted by Cabo Verde when their independence was achieved a year later. The two nations even proposed to merge, but this merger dissolved before it was realized, and a few decades later, Cabo Verde subsequently adopted its own anthem.

1. Sun, sweat, verdure and sea,
Centuries of pain and hope;
This is the land of our ancestors.
Fruit of our hands,
Of the flower of our blood:
This is our beloved country.

Long live our glorious country!
The banner of our struggle
Has fluttered in the skies.
Forward, against the foreign yoke!
We are going to build
Peace and progress
In our immortal country!
Peace and progress
In our immortal country!

Eyes in the same light;
This is the force of our unity!
The sea and the land,
The dawn and the sun are singing
That our struggle has borne fruit!
