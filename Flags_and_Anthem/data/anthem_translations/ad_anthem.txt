National Anthem of Andorra
English Translation
========================================

1. “El Gran Carlemany” presents the nation’s history in a first-person narrative. The anthem was officially adopted on September 8, 1921, the anniversary date of the feast of Our Lady of Meritxell (the Virgin Mary), the patron saint of Andorra.

2. Despite the anthem having been written just before the official change in Catalan orthography, the lyrics using the old orthography are still official in Andorra and in active use.

English translation
The great Charlemagne, my Father, liberated me from the Saracens,
And from heaven he gave me life of Meritxell the great Mother.
I was born a Princess, a Maiden neutral between two nations.
I am the only remaining daughter of the Carolingian empire
Believing and free for eleven centuries, believing and free I will be.
The laws of the land be my tutors, and my defender Princes!
And Princes my defender!
