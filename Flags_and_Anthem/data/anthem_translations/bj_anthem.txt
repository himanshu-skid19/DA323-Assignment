National Anthem of Benin
English Translation
========================================

1. The national anthem was adopted upon independence as Dahomey in 1960. When the country was renamed to Benin in 1975, the anthem was retained (with the name of the country and its citizens changing appropriately), although the new two-syllable name had to fit the three-syllable space in the melody.

CHORUS:
Children of Benin, arise!
The resounding cry of freedom
Is heard at the first light of dawn;
Children of Benin, arise!

32. 1. Formerly, at her call, our ancestors
Knew how to engage in mighty battles
With strength, courage, ardour, and full of joy, but at the price of blood.
Builders of the present, you too, join forces
Each day for the task stronger in unity.
Build without ceasing for posterity.

33. Chorus

34. 2. When all around there blows a wind of anger and hate:
Citizen of Benin, be proud, and in a calm spirit
Trusting in the future, behold your flag!
In the green you read hope of spring;
The red signifies the courage of your ancestors;
The yellow foretells the richest treasures.

35. Chorus

36. 3. Beloved Benin, your sunny mountains, palm trees, and green pastures
Show everywhere your brightness;
Your soil offers everyone the richest fruits.
Benin, from henceforth your sons are united
With one brotherly spirit sharing the hope of seeing you
Enjoy abundance and happiness for ever.
