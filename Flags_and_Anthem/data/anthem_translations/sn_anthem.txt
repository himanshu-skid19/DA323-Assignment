National Anthem of Senegal
English Translation
========================================

1. Senegal first gained independence in June of 1960 in a federation with Mali called the Mali Federation. The anthem of this federation, titled “Un Hymn du Mali” (A Song of Mali), used lyrics written by a prominent Senegalese politician, the music was written by a Malian, and thus was deemed to require replacing when the federation dissolved two months later, as Mali retained the music upon its independence from the federation. New music was written by a French composer who also composed the music for the Central African Republic and the lyrics of the federation’s anthem (whose author was now the country’s first president) were retained, with some slight changes.

2. The “koras” (a harp-lute) and “balafons” (a xylophone-type instrument) mentioned in the anthem title and opening line are native instruments to this African nation, and can be used in the playing of the national anthem.

1. Sound, all of you, your Koras,
Beat the drums,
The red Lion has roared,
The Tamer of the bush with one leap has rushed forward
Scattering the gloom.
Light on our terrors,
Light on our hopes.
Arise, brothers, behold Africa united!

41. CHORUS:
Fibres of my green heart.
Shoulder to shoulder,
O people of Senegal, more than brothers to me, arise!
Unite the sea and the springs,
Unite the steppe and the forest!
Hail, mother Africa,
Hail, mother Africa!

42. 2. Senegal, thou son of the Lion
Arise in the night with great speed,
Restore, oh, restore to us the honour of our ancestors,
Magnificent as ebony and strong as muscles!
We are a straight people-the sword has no fault.

43. Chorus

44. 3. Senegal, we make your great design our own:
To gather the chicks, sheltering them from kites,
To make from them, from East to West, from North to South,
A people rising as one, in seamless unity,
Yet a people facing all the winds of the earth.

45. Chorus

46. 4. Senegal, like thee, like all our heroes,
We will be stern without hatred, and with open arms.
The sword we will put peacefully in its sheath,
For work and words will be our weapon.
The Bantu is our brother, the Arab, and the White man too.

47. Chorus

48. 5. But if the enemy violates our frontiers,
We will all be ready, weapons in our hands;
A people in its faith defying all evil;
Young and old, men and women,
Death, yes! but not dishonour.

49. Chorus
