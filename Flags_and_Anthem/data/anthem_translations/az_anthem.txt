National Anthem of Azerbaijan
English Translation
========================================

1. First adopted as Azerbaijan’s anthem in 1919, a contest for a new national anthem was declared the following year, but a Russian invasion, ending Azerbaijan’s brief independence, ended that. On May 27, 1992, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the “Azerbaijan Marsi,” was re-adopted as the anthem of Azerbaijan. The composer of the anthem was the same person that composed the music to the anthem used by the Azerbaijan SSR.

Azerbaijan! Azerbaijan!
O Great Land, your children are heroes.
We are ready to be martyred for you.
We are ready to shed blood for you.
Three-coloured flag, flourish honourably!
Three-coloured flag, flourish honourably!
Thousands of lives have been sacrificed.
Your bosom has become a battlefield.
Every devoted soldier
Has become a hero.
You are prospering.
My life is always dedicated to you.
My love for you is embedded in my heart
A thousand and one times.
To preserve everything
And to honour her flag
All the youth are willing.
Great Land! Great Land!
Azerbaijan! Azerbaijan!
Azerbaijan! Azerbaijan!
