CHORUS:
United in concord and brotherhood,
Awake, Gabon, dawn is at hand.
Stir up the spirit that thrills and inspires us!
At last we rise up to attain happiness.
At last we rise up to attain happiness.

30. 1. Dazzling and proud, the sublime day dawns,
Dispelling for ever injustice and shame.
May it still advance and calm our fears,
May it promote virtue and banish warfare.

31. Chorus

32. 2. Yes, may the happy days of which our ancestors dreamed
Come for us at last, rejoicing our hearts,
And banish the sorcerers, those perfidious deceivers
Who sowed poison and spread fear.

33. Chorus

34. 3. So that, in the eyes of the world and of friendly nations,
The immortal Gabon may maintain her good repute,
Let us forget our quarrels, let us build together
The new structure of which we all have dreamed.

35. Chorus

36. 4. From the shores of the Ocean to the heart of the forest,
Let us remain vigilant, without weakness and without hatred!
Around this flag which leads us to honour,
Let us salute the Fatherland and ever sing!
