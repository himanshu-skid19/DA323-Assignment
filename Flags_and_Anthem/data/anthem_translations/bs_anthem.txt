National Anthem of Bahamas
English Translation
========================================

“March On, Bahamaland!” was selected as the winning entry in a national competition, and was adopted on independence July 10, 1973. Since Bahamas retains the British royal family as their head of state, their royal anthem, God Save the King, is used as the royal anthem of the Bahamas as well.
