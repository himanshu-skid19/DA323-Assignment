CHORUS:
Repeat, Oh World, my song.
Echo it over and over again.
Remember, through my joy, each martyr.
Clothe him with the shining mantles Of our festival.

52. Repeat, Oh World, my song.
Repeat, Oh World, my song.

53. 1. Oh my country, we are sons and grandsons of your men.
We will guard all of your majesty in our hands.
Its light will be immortal on all ways
Every rock on your mountains, all atoms of your soils

54. 2. All wets of your waters, are our mine.
There are for our large wishes, and our right.
Came from your past’s pretty glories.

55. Chorus

56. 3. My unity, Oh marvellous song fill myself
You are promise in our response
My banner, Oh cloth nailed from every sun
Raise forever on every peak
My nation, give me strength, Oh source of strength
And save me for you, best nation

57. 4. In faith and love I am part of mankind.
An Arab I am in all my life.
My heart beats in tune with Yemen.
No foreigner shall dominate over Yemen.
