National Anthem of Honduras
English Translation
========================================

1. Before the current anthem was adopted in 1915, other patriotic songs were unofficially used in Honduras. The current anthem is like many others in Latin America in that the music has an operatic, “epic” feel to it (the composer was born in Germany), and has many verses (in this case, seven), which schoolchildren are expected to memorize in its entirety as a way of learning the country’s history, even though the chorus and the last verse are usually only used on official occasions. As such, it can be classified as a “Latin American epic anthem”.

2. A unique aspect of the Honduran anthem, however, is that it chronicles the history of the country in its seven verses. The first verse describes the country as Christopher Columbus, the first European to land in Honduras, would have seen it. The second tells of how men “from a country where the sun rises” dreamt of Honduras and go out to seek it. Upon arrival, they find that a flag (Spain’s) has been placed there. The third verse chronicles the native population’s attempted resistance against the Spanish. The fourth speaks of the three centuries under Spanish rule, and how requests for change from the colonies, like Honduras, were unheeded; until one day when news of revolution in Europe reached the Americas. Verse 5 continues this thought, stating how the French revolution was a model for those in Honduras seeking redress from Spain. The next verse (verse six) chronicles the revolutions that occurred in the Spanish colonies in America, as one by one they gained liberation from Spain, including Honduras (as part of the Central American federation, at first.) The final verse is a cry to all Hondurans to defend the nation, even in death if necessary.

3. The chorus, sung after each verse and at the start of the anthem (if all verses are sung), or at the start and end of the anthem, with the last verse sandwiched between them (as is performed at official occassions) is a description of the flag and coat of arms of Honduras.

CHORUS:
Your flag is a splendour of sky
Crossed with a band of snow;
And there can be seen, in its sacred depths,
Five pale blue stars.
In your emblem, which a rough sea
With its wild waves protects,
Behind the bare summit of a volcano,
A star brightly shines.

64. Chorus

65. 1. Like an Indian maiden you have been sleeping,
Lulled by the resonant song of your seas,
When, set in your golden valleys,
The bold navigator found you;
And on seeing, enraptured, your beauty,
And feeling your enchantment,
He dedicated a kiss of love to the blue hem
of your splendid mantle.

66. Chorus

67. 2. From a country where the sun rises,
Beyond the blue Atlantic,
That man who had dreamt you
In search of you he launched to sea.
When you raised your pale forehead,
In the lively anxiousness of your hope,
Under the gentle dome of your sky
Already floated a strange banner.

68. Chorus

69. 3. It was useless that your beloved Indian
Rushed into the fight with ire,
Because, covered with his blood, Lempira,
In the deep night he sank;
And of the heroic deed, in memory,
The legend alone has kept
A sepulcher in a forgotten place,
And the severe profile of a mountain peak.

70. Chorus

71. 4. For three centuries your children heard
The imperious mandate of the master;
For three centuries your useless complaint
In the blue atmosphere was lost
But one glorious day your ear
Perceived, powerful and distant,
That there, far away, over the Atlantic,
Indignantly, a lion roared

72. Chorus

73. 5. It was France, the free, the heroic,
Which in its dreams of centuries slept,
Awoke irate to life
At the virile protest of Danton:
It was France, who sent to the death
The head of the consecrated King,
And which built up proudly at its side,
The altar of the goddess of Reason.

74. Chorus

75. 6. You also, oh my country!, arose
From your servile deep sleep;
You also showed the world
The infamous shackle destroyed.
And in your blessed soil, behind the tall
Hair of the wild jungle,
Like a bird of black feathers,
The fleeting colony was lost.

76. Chorus

77. 7. To guard this sacred emblem
We shall march, oh fatherland, to our death;
Our death will be honoured
If we die thinking of your love.
Having defended your holy flag,
And shrouded in its glorious folds,
Many, Honduras, shall die for you,
But shall fall in honour.
