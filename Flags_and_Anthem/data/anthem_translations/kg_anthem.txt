National Anthem of Kyrgyzstan
English Translation
========================================

1. Instead of using the former anthem used as a Soviet republic as a national anthem for the new nation created in 1991 like many of its Central Asian neighbours (see Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan for examples), Kyrgyzstan adopted a brand new anthem in 1992, whose melody is slightly reminiscent of the native music to Central Asia, where this republic is located.
