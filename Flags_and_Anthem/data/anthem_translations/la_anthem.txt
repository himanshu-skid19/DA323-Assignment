National Anthem of Laos
English Translation
========================================

1. The Laos anthem was composed in 1941 and was first used when the Kingdom of Laos was created in 1947. Despite the original lyrics (sheet music with Lao lyrics (Lao and Latin scripts)) lacking references to the royal family, the lyrics were changed after the 1975 communist revolution that deposed the royal family; the melody, however, was retained.

2. Special thanks to: Jo Hyo-roe for the sheet music.

English translation
For all time the Lao people have glorified their Fatherland,
United in heart, spirit and vigour as one.
Resolutely and increasing the dignity of the Lao people
And proclaiming the right to be their own masters.
The Lao people of all origins are equal
And will no longer allow imperialists and traitors to harm them.
The entire people will safeguard the independence
And the freedom of the Lao nation.
They are resolved to struggle for victory
In order to lead the nation to prosperity.
