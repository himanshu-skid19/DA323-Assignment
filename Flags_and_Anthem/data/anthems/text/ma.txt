Root of the free,Rising place of the Lights,Forum of glory and its protector,May you perpetuate as its forum and its protector.May you live among the homelandsAs an address for grandeurFilling every gardenconveyed by every tongue.With the spirit,With the body,Your son has comeTo answer your call.In my mouth and in my blood,Your love stirred up as light and fire.Let's go brothers!Heading for grandeur,Making the world witnessThat we here perpetually liveWith the motto:God, Homeland, King.
