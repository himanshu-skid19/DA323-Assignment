IBrave Quisqueyans, let us raiseOur song with vivid emotion,And let’s show to the face of the EarthOur unconquered, glorious banner.Hail, the people who strong and intrepid,Into war launched itself set to dieWhen in a warring challenge to the deathIts chains of slavery cut off.No people deserves to be freeIf it’s an indolent and servile slave;If in its chest doesn't grow the flamethat forged the virile heroism.But Quisqueya the brave and indomitableAlways proudly her forehead will raiseFor if she were a thousand times a slaveThis many times will she be free.IIAnd if fraud and cunning exposed herTo disdain of an intrusive man,Las Carreras! Beler!...were fieldsWhich covered in glory were seen.At the top of heroic bastion,Word of the free was materialized,Where the genius of Sanchez and DuarteTaught to be free or to die.And if an inconsiderate rulerCould tarnish the glow of such glories,The war banner of fire was seenWaving over Capotillo.And the fire that leaves stunnedThe arrogant lion from Castile,Pulls it away from the glorious beachesWhere the crossed banner floats.IIICompatriots, let’s hold ourForehead high, like never before;For Quisqueya will be destroyedBut it will never again be enslaved.That every chest is a shrine of loveWhere one feels the homeland alive;It is the law her invincible shield;It is her motto be free or die.Liberty that serenely stands upVictory in her triumphal carriage.The trumpet of war still resoundsProclaiming her immortal gloryFreedom! Let the echoes agitateWhile full of noble anxietyOur battlefields of glory reverb these words -Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!
