Respect for citizenship is strong in our Ethiopia;National pride is seen, shining from one side to another.For peace, for justice, for the freedom of peoples,In equality and in love we stand united.Firm of foundation, we do not dismiss humanness;We are people who live through work.Wonderful is the stage of tradition, owners of a proud heritage,Natural grace, mother of a valorous people.We shall protect you â€“ we have a duty;Our Ethiopia, live! And let us be proud of you!
