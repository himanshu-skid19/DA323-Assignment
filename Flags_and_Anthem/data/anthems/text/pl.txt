The blow struck with such skill, with such force unsurpassed,That the strings rang out boldly, like trumpets of brass,And from them to the heavens that song wafted, cherished,That triumphal march: Poland has never yet perished!...March Dąbrowski to Poland! – The audience entireClapped, and all "March Dąbrowski!" cried out as a choir.
