Chorus:People of Chad, arise and to work!You have conqueredyour soiland won your rights;Your freedom will be born of your courage.Lift up your eyes, the future is yours.IO my Country, mayGodprotect you,May your neighbors admire your children.Joyful, peaceful, advance as you sing,Faithful to your fathers who are watching you.ChorusIIRace of the North, and its immense herds,Race of the South, who cultivates the fields.Shepherds, mountaineers, fishers and traders,Let us be a single great people who advances.ChorusIIIHoe in hand, valiantly make your rope,See your children who are tomented by hunger,The fields before you wait for your grain.Let oil flow and your granaries overflow.ChorusIVYour engineers will trace roads on youYour physicians will make you big and strongTo the student's work, without worrying about the effortPut ignorance and evil in debacle.Chorus
