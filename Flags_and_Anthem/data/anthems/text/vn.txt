ISoldiers of Vietnam, we go forward, with the heart to save the nationOur hurried steps are sounding on the long and arduous roadOur flag, red with the blood of victory, bears the spirit of our country,the distant rumbling of the guns mingles with our marching song.The path to glory passes over the bodies of our foes.Overcoming all hardships, together we build our resistance bases.Chorus:Ceaselessly for the people's cause we struggle,Hastening to the battlefield!Advance! All together advancing!Our Vietnam is strong eternal.IISoldiers of Vietnam, we go forward, the gold star of our flag in the windLeading our people, our native land, out of misery and sufferingLet us join our efforts in the fight for the building of a new life.Let us stand up and break our chains.For too long have we swallowed our hatredLet us keep ready for all sacrifices and our life will be radiant.Chorus
