ILesotho, land of our Fathers,Among the lands she is the most beautiful.She is where we were born,She is where we grew up,We love her.IIGod, please protect Lesotho.Spare it conflict and tribulation,Oh, this land,Land of our Fathers,May it have peace. ILesotho is the land of our ancestorsYou are the best of the world;That's where we were born,That's where we grew up,We love you,IIThough some say she is small,For us she is big, enoughWe have fields,We have cattle;It is enough for us.IIIAnd though you need many things,And praise from nations,You have mountains,Pastures, wells,It's lovely.IVSo much for our worldYou already have the word of the Lord;People are praying,And the trends are coming to an end.VGod save Lesotho;End wars and anxieties;Oh this earth;Land of our fathers;Be at peace.
