IMerry Guatemala…! Your altarsThe fierce executionerno longer bloodies,There are no cowards who lick the yokeNor tyrants who spit on your face.If tomorrow your sacred groundIs profaned by foreign invasionStained in blood, your beautiful flagWill serve as a shroud for the bold.Chorus I:Stained in blood, your beautiful flagWill serve as a shroud for the bold,May your people with fierce spiritBe rather dead than a slave.IIFrom your old and hard chainsYou smelted with an angry handThe plough that fertilizes the soil,And the sword that saves honor.Our fathers fought one dayBurning with national ardor,They tore you from the bloody rackAnd lifted you a throne of love.Chorus II:They tore you from the bloody rackAnd lifted you a throne of love.May from fatherland to the energetic focusCrime die and error sink.IIIYour ensignis a piece of heavenBetween clouds of clear whitenessAnd woe to he who perjures with handDares to stain its colors!May your brave and proud childrenSee with joy in the rough fightThe torrent of blood that emanatesFrom the steel to the vibrant clash.Chorus III:The torrent of blood that emanatesFrom the steel to the vibrant clash,Which is only the honor of their medalAnd the altar of the fatherland, their altar.IVLying on the superb AndesFrom two seas to the sonorous noiseUnder the wing of scarlet and goldYou fall asleep to the beautifulquetzal.Indian bird that lives onyour coat of arms,Palladium that protects your soilMay it take its flightMore than the condor and the golden eagle!Chorus IV:May it take its flightMore than the condor and the golden eagle,And on its wings lift up to the sky,Guatemala, your immortal name! IMerry Guatemala…! That your altarsNever be profaned by the tormentor,Nor there be slaves who lick the yokeNor tyrants who spit on your face.If tomorrow your sacred groundIs threatened by foreign invasionFree to the wind,your beautiful flagTo victory or death it will call.Chorus I:Free to the wind, your beautiful flagTo victory or death it will call;That your people with fierce spiritRather dead than slave become.IIFrom your old and hard chainsYou forged with an angry handThe plough that fertilizes the soil,And the sword that saves honor.Our fathers fought one dayBurning with patriotic fervor,Andmanaged without a bloody clashTo place you on a throne of love.Chorus II:And managed without a bloody clashTo place you on a throne of love,Which from fatherland in energetic focusGave life to the redemptive ideal.IIIA piece of heaven your ensign isIn which a cloud enlightens its alabasterAnd… woe to him who with blind madnessIts colors intends to stain!Because your brave and proud children,Who venerate peace as a prized gift,Never dodge the rough fightIf they defend their land and their home.Chorus III:Never dodge the rough fightIf they defend their land and their home,That honor is their guiding cryAnd the altar of the fatherland their altar.IVLeaning on the proud alpFrom two seas to the sonorous noiseUnder the wing of scarlet and goldYou are dazzled by the beautifulquetzal.Indian bird that lives inyour shield,Palladiumthat protects your landMay it take its flightHigher than thecondorand the golden eagle!Chorus IV:May it take its flightHigherthan the condor and the golden eagle,And on its wings lift up to the sky,Guatemala, your immortal name!
