Chorus:O happy Rome - O noble RomeYou are the seat of Peter, who shed his blood in Rome,Peter, to whom the keys of the kingdom of heaven were given.Pontiff, You are the successor of Peter;Pontiff, You are the teacher, you confirm your brethren;Pontiff, You who are the Servant of the servants of God,and fisher of men, are the shepherd of the flock,linking heaven and earth.Pontiff, You are the vicar of Christ on earth,a rock amidst the waves, You are a beacon in the darkness;You are the defender of peace, You are the guardian of unity,watchful defender of liberty; in You is the authority.Sopranos, altos:Pontiff, you are the unshakable rock, and on this rockwas built the Church of God.Tenors, basses:Pontiff, You are the vicar of Christ on earth,a rock amidst the waves, You are a beacon in the darkness;You are the defender of peace, You are the guardian of unity,watchful defender of liberty; in You is the authority.ChorusO happy Rome - O noble Rome.
