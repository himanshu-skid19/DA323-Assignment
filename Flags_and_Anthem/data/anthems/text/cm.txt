IOCameroon, Thou Cradle of our Fathers,Holy Shrine where in our midst they now repose,Their tears and blood and sweat thy soil did water,On thy hills and valleys once their tillage rose.DearFatherland, thy worth no tongue can tell!How can we ever pay thy due?Thy welfare we will win in toil and love and peace,Will be to thy name ever true!Chorus:Land of Promise, land of Glory!Thou, of life and joy, our only store!Thine be honour, thine emotion,And deep endearment, for evermore.IIFromShari, from where theMungomeandersFrom along the banks of lowlyBoumba Stream,Muster thy sons in union close around thee,Mighty as theBuea Mountainbe their team;Instil in them the love of gentle ways,Regret for errors ofthe past;Foster, forMother Africa, a loyaltyThat true shall remain to the last.Chorus IƆ̌ Kamerûn, thǝ́si pɔ́k mʉǝ̂gǝ̌jʉ',Lu tsuú sí bíŋ cǝŋtǝ bɔ́mtǝ́ yu lǝ̀pʉǝ̀Pâ' tsǝ́nam á, yu dzǝ̂gûŋ gɔ pǝ́ lǝŋnyǝPǝ́ syamtiŋ gwyǝ́ nǝ́ nǝ́pîŋ pû ntàmtǝ̀Gaǝ́ pô pǔ awɛ́ jyǝŋka' baa kwopM ntǝ̂mnàm, m Bînam pǝ́ ntʉm ŋkùŋnyǝ̀Nǝ́ pǝ̂ fá' bû pǝ́ da' máp mntǝ́mdyǝ́Nǝ́ǝ gǝ́ǝ máp mfa' nǝ́ǝ guŋ mcwǝ awɛ́.Píŋzhwòp:Ɔ̌ guŋ mtʉǝdǝ̀ŋ, ɔ̌ cá' mtʉǝdǝ̀ŋ,Ó o bǝ́ tsuú da' yɔk nǝ́puŋ nínyɔ,Da' yɔk ŋwɛ́nyǝ́, baa yɔk nɛ́ǝ́cwǝ̂Ŋkuŋnyǝ pǝ́ buu ba ghámt e gwyǝ́ bû. IOCameroon, cradle ofour ancestors,You once lived in barbarism,Like a sun, you start to appear,Little by little you come out of your savagery,May all your children, fromNorthtoSouthFromEasttoWest, be all love,May serving you be our only goalTo fulfil their duty always.Chorus:DearFatherland, dear land,You are our unique and true happiness.Our joy and our lifeTo you, love and great honour.IIYou are the grave where our fathers sleep,Thegarden that our ancestorshave cultivated.We work to make you prosperousOne fine day we will finally get there.Be Africa's faithful childAnd always progress in peaceHoping thatyour young childrenWill love you without bounds forever.Chorus
