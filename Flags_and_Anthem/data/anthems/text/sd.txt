We are soldiers of god, soldiers of the homelandIf called for redemption we will not betrayWe defy death upon ordealsWe buy glory at the most expensive priceThis land is ours, long live our SudanAn edifice among the nationsO Sons of the Sudan this is your symbol,Carries the burden and protecting your land We are the lions of the jungle, the sons of warsWe do not fear death or fear engagementsWe keep Sudan in these heartsWe redeem it from North or SouthWith bitter struggle and solid determinationAnd hearts of unrelenting ironWe defeat evil and deliver the usurpersAs the air eagles or the lion of the denWe fend off deathWe repel those who attackWe respond whomever unjustAnd protect the flag
