Noble fatherland! Your beautiful flagshows us the expression of your life;under the limpid blue of your sky,white and pure, rests peace.In the tenacious struggle, of fecund labour,that reddens the man's face;your children, simple farmhands, conquered𝄆 eternal prestige, esteem and honour. 𝄇Hail, oh gentle land!Hail, oh mother of love!When someone intends to tarnish your glory,you will see your people, brave and virile,the rustic tool into a weapon transform.Hail, oh fatherland! Your prodigal soilgives us sweet warmth and sustenance;under the limpid blue of your sky,may work and peace always live!
