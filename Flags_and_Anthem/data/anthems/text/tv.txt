ITuvalu for the AlmightyAre the words we hold most dearFor as people or as leadersOf Tuvalu we all shareIn the knowledge that GodEver rules in heav’n above,And that we in this landAre united in His love.We build on a sure foundationWhen we trust in God’s great law“Tuvalu for the Almighty”Be our song for evermore!IILet us trust our lives henceforwardTo the King to whom we pray,With our eyes fixed firmly on HimHe is showing us the way.“May we reign with Him in glory”Be our song for evermore,for His almighty powerIs our strength from shore to shore.Shout aloud in jubilationTo the King whom we adore.“Tuvalu free and united”Be our song for evermore!
