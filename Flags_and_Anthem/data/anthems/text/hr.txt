IOur beautiful homeland,Oh so fearless and gracious,Our fathers' ancient glory,May you be blessed forever.Dear, you are our only glory,Dear, you are our only one,Dear, we love your plains,Dear, we love your mountains.IIDrava,Sava, keep on flowing,Danube, do not lose your vigour,Deep blue sea, tell the world,That a Croat loves his homeland.Whilst his fields are kissed by sunshine,Whilst his oaks are whipped by wild winds,Whilst his dear ones go to heaven,Whilst his live heart beats. Our beautiful homeland,Oh so fearless and gracious,Our father's ancient glory,May you be happy forever.Beloved, how glorious you are,You are beloved, our only one,Beloved, wherever you are plain,Beloved, wherever you are mountain!Clear sky, clear forehead,Gentle people, mild nights,Hot summer, hard work,Clear waters, clear eyes:Great mountains, great people,Red faces, red wines,Mighty thunders, mighty limbs;This is our homeland!Sickles are reaping, scythes sweeping,Old man is busy, counting sheaves,Carriages are creaking, carrying flour,Bride knits and breastfeeds a child;Cattle are grazing, horn is heard,Oh, oh it rings, oh into darkness,To the fire, youth and elders are going;Here's our homeland!Light in the dark shines far,All over cheerful meadow,Songs are loudly echoed by hills,Lovers are singing totamburica:They dance thekolo, lively kolo,On the hill, and in the valley,Youth is dancing all around;We are, my friend, inhomeland!What is the fog hiding there?Isn't that our peoples awful screams?Who prays for death?The freeborn, or the slaves?"It is war, brothers, war, heroes,Grab your rifle, take a saber,Saddle your horses, let's go infantrymen,There be glory, where ours are!"Gales roar, fog is lifting,Dawn breaks, darkness runs,Sorrow fades, joy arrives,Hello freedom, foe laid low!Be joyful, sad mother,Your brave sons have fallen,Like heroes, like Croats,Shedding blood for homeland!Flow, fastSava, flow,Nor you Danube, lose your power,Wherever you're murmuring, tell the world:That a Croat loves his home,Whilst the sun warms his fields,Whilst winds lash his oak trees,Whilst graves cover his fallen,Whilst his living heart is beating.
