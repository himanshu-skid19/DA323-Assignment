God bless AfricaMay her horn rise up high Hear our prayersLord bless us, as your children. Lord we ask You to protect our nation,End all conflicts and troublesProtect us, protect our nation,The nation of South Africa, South Africa. From the blue of our heavensFrom the depths of our sea,Over our eternal mountain rangesWhere the cliffs give an echo. Sounds the call to come together,And united we shall stand.Let us live and strive for freedom,In South Africa, our land.
