Lift up your head to the rising sun, Bahamaland;March on to glory, your bright banners waving high.See how the world marks the manner of your bearing!Pledge to excel through love and unity.Pressing onward, march togetherto a common loftier goal;Steady sunward, tho' the weatherhide the wide and treacherous shoal.Lift up your head to the rising sun, Bahamaland,'Til the road you've trod lead unto your God,March on, Bahamaland!
