IAgainst the humiliating bondage of a thousand yearsRapacity came from afar to subjugate them for a hundred years.Againstthe cynical malicein the shapeOfneo-colonialismand itspetty localservants.Many gave in and certain others resisted.But the frustrations, the successes, the sweat, the bloodHave fortified our courageous peopleAnd fertilised its heroic struggle.Chorus:And one single night has drawn togetherThe history of an entire people,And one single night has launched its triumphal march.Towards the horizon of good fortune.One single night has brought togetherour peopleWith all the peoples of the World,In the acquisition of liberty and progress.Fatherlandor death, we shall conquer!IINourished in the lively source of the Revolution,The volunteers for liberty and peaceWith their nocturnal and beneficial energies of the 4th of AugustHad not only hand arms, but also and above allThe flame in their hearts lawfully to freeFaso forever fromthe fettersof those whoHere and there were polluting the sacred soul ofIndependence and sovereignty.ChorusIIIAnd seated henceforth in rediscovered dignity,Love and honour partnered with humanity,The people of Burkina sing a victory hymnTo the glory of the work of liberation and emancipation.Down withexploitation of man by man!Forward for the good of every manBy all men of today and tomorrow,By every man here and always!ChorusIVPopular revolution our nourishing sap.Undying motherhood of progress in the face of man.Eternal hearth of agreed democracy,Where at last national identity has the right of freedom.Whereinjustice has lost its place forever,And where from the hands of builders of a glorious worldEverywhere the harvests of patriotic vows ripen,Suns of boundless joy shine.Chorus
