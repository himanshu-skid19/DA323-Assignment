ISun, sweat,verdureandsea,Centuries of pain and hope;This is theland of our ancestors!Fruit of our hands,Of the flower of our blood:This is ourbeloved fatherland.Chorus:Long liveour glorious fatherland!Thebanner of the strugglehas fluttered in the skies.Forward, againstthe foreign yoke!𝄆 We are going to buildInour immortal fatherlandPeace and progress! 𝄇IIBranches of the same trunk,Eyes in the same light;This is the force of our union!The seaandthe landsing,The dawn and the sunThatour strugglefertilised!Chorus
