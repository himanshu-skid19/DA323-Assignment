IOn this day the sun risesAndour Congostands resplendent.Along nightis ended,A great happiness has come.Let us all, with wild joyfulness, singThe song of freedom.Chorus:Arise, Congolese, proud every man,Proclaim the unity of our nation.Let us forget what divides usAnd become more united than ever.Let us live our motto:Unity, work, progress.Let us live our motto:Unity, work, progress!IIFrom the forest to the savannah,From the savannah tothe sea,One people, one soul,One heart, ardent and proud.Let us all fight, every one of us,Forour black country.ChorusIIIAnd if we have to die,What does it really matter? Our childrenEverywhere will be able to say howTriumph comes through battle,And inthe smallest villageSing beneathour three colours.Chorus
