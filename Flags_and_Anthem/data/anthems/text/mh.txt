My island lies o'er the ocean;Like a wreath of flowers upon the sea;With the light of the Maker from far above;Shining with the brilliance of rays of life;(𝄆) Our Father's wondrous creation;Bequeathed to us, our motherland;I'll never leave my dear home sweet home;God of our forefathers protect and bless forever Marshall Islands.
