Long live my country, the unity of ourEmirateslives.You've lived for the nation's faith ofIslamand guide of theQuran.I've made you stronger in God's name – oh, homeland.My country, my country, my country, my country.God protected you from the evils of time.We have sworn to build and work –work earnestly, work earnestly.As long as we live, we will be sincere.The safety has lasted, the flag has lived – oh, our Emirates!The symbol of Arabism: we all sacrifice and shed blood for you;For you we sacrifice with our souls – oh, homeland!
