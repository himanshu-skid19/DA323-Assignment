I𝄆 We swear by the lightning that destroys,By the streams of generous blood being shed, 𝄇By the bright flags that wave,Flying proudly on the high mountainsThat we are in revolt, whether to live or to die,We are determined that Algeria should live,So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!II𝄆 We are soldiers, for the sake of justice we revolted,And for our independence we waged war, 𝄇When we spoke, nobody listened to us,So we have taken the noise of gunpowder as our rhythmAnd the sound of machine guns as our melody,We are determined that Algeria should live,So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!III𝄆 O France, the time of reproof is overAnd we have closed it as a book is closed; 𝄇O France, this is the day of reckoningSo prepare to receive from us our answer!In our revolution is the end of empty talk;We are determined that Algeria should live,So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!IV𝄆 From our heroes we shall make an army come to being,From our dead we shall build up a glory, 𝄇Our spirits shall ascend to immortalityAnd on our shoulders we shall raise the Standard.To the nation's Liberation Front we have sworn an oath,We are determined that Algeria should live,So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!V𝄆 The cry of the motherland sounds from the battlefields.Listen to it and answer the call! 𝄇Let it be written with the blood of martyrsAnd be read to future generations.Oh, Glory, we have held out our hand to you,We are determined that Algeria should live,So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!
