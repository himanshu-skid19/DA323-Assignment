Chorus:Your flag, your flag is a splendour of skyCrossed by a block, by a block of snow;And seen on its sacred backgroundAre five stars of pale blue;Onyour emblem, which a roaring seaShields with its rough waves,Behind the bare summit of a volcano, of a volcano,There is a star, there is a star of clear light.VIITo keep that divine emblem,Let us march, oh fatherland, to death,Generous will be our fate,If we die thinking of your love.Defending your holy flagAnd covered in your glorious folds,There will be many, Honduras, of your dead,But all will fall with honour.Chorus Chorus:Your flag, your flag is a splendour of skyCrossed by a block, by a block of snow;And seen on its sacred backgroundAre five stars of pale blue;Onyour emblem, which a roaring seaShields with its rough waves,Behind the bare summit of a volcano, of a volcano,There is a star, there is a star of clear light.IA virgin and beautifulIndian, you were sleepingTo the resonant song of your seas,When thrown into your basins of goldThe bold navigatorfound you;And looking at your beauty, ecstaticAt the ideal influence of your charm,The blue hem of your splendid mantleHe consecrated with his kiss of love.ChorusIIFrom a country where the sun rises,Beyond the blue Atlantean,That man had dreamt of youAnd in search of you launched himself into the sea.When you raised your pale forehead,In the lively anxiety of your longing,Under the gentle dome of your skyA foreign bannerwas already floating.ChorusIIIIt was useless that the Indian, your beloved,Prepare to fight with ire,Because, enveloped in his blood,LempiraSank into the deep night;And of the epic feat, in memory,The legend alone has keptFrom a tombthe unknown placeAndthe harsh profile of a crag.ChorusIVFor three centuries your children listenedTo the imperative mandate ofthe master;For three centuries your useless complaintWas lost in the blue atmosphere;But one glorious day your earPerceived, powerful and distant,That far away, over the Atlante,A Lion roared indignantly.ChorusVIt was France, the free, the heroic,That in her sleep of centuries asleepAwoke angryto lifeAt the virile complaint ofDanton:It was France, thatsent to deathThe head ofthe consecrated King,And that raised proud at his side,The altar of the goddess reason.ChorusVIYou too, oh my fatherland!,aroseFrom your servile and deep sleep;You also taught the worldThe infamous shattered link.And in your blessed soil, behind the tallHair of the wild jungle,Like a bird of black plumage,The fleeting colonywas lost.ChorusVIITo keep that divine emblem,Let us march, oh fatherland, to death,Generous will be our fate,If we die thinking of your love.Defending your holy flagAnd covered in your glorious folds,There will be many, Honduras, of your dead,But all will fall with honour.Chorus
