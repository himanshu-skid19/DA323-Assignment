IGod of Justice; Thou who saved uswhen in deepest bondage cast,Hear Thy Serbian children's voices,Be our help as in the past.With Thy mighty hand sustain us,Still our rugged pathway trace;𝄆 God, our hope; protect and cherish,Serbian lands and Serbian race! 𝄇IIBind in closest links our kindredTeach the love that will not fail,May the loathed fiend of discordNever in our ranks prevail.Let the golden fruits of unionOur young tree of freedom grace;𝄆 God, our Master! Guide and prosper,Serbian lands and Serbian race! 𝄇IIILord! Avert from us Thy vengeance,Thunder of Thy dreaded ire;Bless each Serbian town and hamlet,Mountain, meadow, hearth and spire!When our host goes forth to battleDeath or victory to embrace-𝄆 God of armies! Be our leader,Strengthen then the Serbian race! 𝄇IVOn our sepulcher of agesBreaks the resurrection morn,From the slough of direst slaverySerbia anew is born.Through five hundred years of duranceWe have knelt before Thy face,𝄆 All our kin, O God! Deliver,Thus entreats the Serbian race! 𝄇
