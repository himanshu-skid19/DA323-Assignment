Oh! Central Africa, cradle of theBantu!Take up again your right to respect, to life!Long subjugated, long scorned by all,But, from today, breakingtyranny's hold.Through work, order and dignityYou reconquer your rights, your unity,And to take this new stepThe voice of our ancestors call us.Chorus:To work! In order and dignity,In the respect for rights and in unity,Breakingpovertyandtyranny,Holding highthe standard of the Fatherland.
