Let us dismiss all the evil spirits that hinder national unity.Let us fight it as the imperialism.The settling of accounts, hatred and anarchyMerely stop the revolution.If we are divided, the enemy infiltratesIn our ranks to exploit us.Chorus:To the Union, Union, Union,Oh,Togolese!Our ancestors call us.Peace, Peace, Peace,Oh, Togolese!Our forefathers instructed it us.Let's not forget all of the historic appeal of 30 August 69.Let's listen to the sound forever.Our way of salvation is the Rally,Rally of all the TogoleseFor the great victory. Togo arise!Carry the torch of the Union!ChorusLet us dismiss the evil spirit that hinders African Unity.Let us dismiss it like imperialism.The shots of cannons and rifle firesJust slow the impetus of Africa.From our disunity imperialism profits,It benefits much to oppose us.ChorusPeace, Peace, Peace,Oh, God! Peace,Peace for Africa!Peace, Peace, Peace,Oh, God! Peace,Peace for Africa
