Forged from the love of unityIn the fires of hope and prayerWith boundless faith in our destinyWest Indians all declare:Side by side we standWith our hearts joined across the seaThis our native landWe pledge ourselves for thee.𝄆 Here every creed and race find an equal place,And may God bless our nation. 𝄇
