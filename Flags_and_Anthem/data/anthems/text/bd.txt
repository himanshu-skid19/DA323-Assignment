My golden Bengal, thee I love.Forever thy skies be, thine air like a flute set my heart in tune;OMother, aroma of mango orchard inFalgundriveth me crazy,Ah, such miraculousness!O Mother, time seeth inOgrohayonsmiles sweet all through fields of paddy.What beauty, what shades, what affection, what tenderness;What a quilt thou hast spread at tip of banyans 'long ev'ry bank,O Mother, words from thy lips like nectar to my ears.Ah, such miraculousness!If sadness, o mother, cast a gloom on thy face, my eyes filled with tears.Spending my childhood in thy playhouseThy soil o'er my body smeared, I consider myself privileged.Wonderful lamp at dusk thou lightest,Ah, such miraculousness!At once I quit playing and sprint back to thy lap, o mother.In cattle grazing field, on pier for crossing stream,Shaded village walkways, serene with calling birdsOpen porch with heaped ripe paddy, my life goeth on.Ah, such miraculousness!All thy shepherds and farmers are my brothers.This time I offer my head beneath thy feet,Bless me with thy dust, obliged shall I be to flaunt overhead.To thee I shall offer meagrely whatever I have at home,Ah, such miraculousness!Ne'er bothered to buy thee from others a hanging rope coronal guise.
