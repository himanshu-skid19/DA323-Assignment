Hail to thee, Nicaragua! On thy landroareth the voice of the cannon no more,𝄆 nor doeth the blood of brothers now stainthy glorious bicolor banner. 𝄇Let peace shine beautifully in thy sky,and nothing dimmeth thine immortal glory,for labor is thy well-earned laureland honor is thy triumphal emblem,is thy triumphal emblem!
