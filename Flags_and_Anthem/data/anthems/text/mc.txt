Greetings, you who are our neighbours!Greetings, you who are watching us!It is important that everyone remembers the following:Chorus:Forever, in our land,One flaghas flown in the windForever, the colours red and whiteHave symbolised our libertyAdults and children have always respected them.We have perpetuated the same traditions;We celebrate the same religion;We have the honourTo have always had the same Princes.And nothing will changeAs long as the sun shines;God will always help usAnd nothing will change.Chorus Historically, the same flagFloats happily in the wind of our countryAlways the colours red and whiteHave been the symbol of our freedomGreat and small have always respected it!Greetings, you who are our neighbours!Greetings, you who are watching us!It is important that everyone remembers the following:Chorus:We have perpetuated the same traditions;We celebrate the same religion;We have the honourTo have always had the same PrincesAnd no one can make us changeAs long as the sun shines in the skyGod help usAnd no one can evermake us changeNo one.There are not very many of us,But we all strive to defend our traditions;We are not very powerful,But if he wants to, God will help us!Greetings, you who are our neighbours!Greetings, you who are watching us!It is important that everyone is well aware of that!Chorus Principality of Monaco my countryOh! How God is lavish with you.The sky always pure, the shores always blooming [with flowers],Your Monarch is more revered than a King.Proud Companions of the Civic Guard,Let us all respect the voice of the Commander.Always follow our old banner.The drum beats, let us all walk ahead.Yes, Monaco always had brave men,We are all their worthy descendants.Never were we slaves.And far from us the tyrants ruled.That the name of a merciful PrinceBe repeated by a thousand songs.We shall all die in his own defence,But after us, our children will fight.
