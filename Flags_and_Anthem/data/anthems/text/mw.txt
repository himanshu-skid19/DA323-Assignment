IO God bless our land ofMalawi,Keep it a land of peace.Put down each and every enemy,Hunger, disease, envy.Join together all our hearts as one,That we be free from fear.Blessour leader, each and every one,And Mother Malawi.IIOur own Malawi, this land so fair,Fertile and brave and free.With its lakes, refreshing mountain air,How greatly blest are we.Hills and valleys, soil so rich and rareGive us a bounty free.Wood and forest, plains so broad and fair,All - beauteous Malawi.IIIFreedom ever, let us all uniteTo build up Malawi.With our love, our zeal and loyalty,Bringing our best to her.Intime of war, or in time of peace,One purpose and one goal.Men and women serving selflesslyIn building Malawi.
