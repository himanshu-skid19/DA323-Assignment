Glory be to you!Now your breast, your breast, overflows,Now your breast overflows with joy and peace;ùÑÜ And your forehead, your radiant foreheadwe contemplate shining more than the Sun. ùÑáII:The firsts, the sons ofthe soilWhichPichinchasuperbly adorns,Declared you as their sovereign lady forever,And shed their blood for you.God observed and accepted theholocaust,And that blood was the fertile germOf other heroes whom the world in astonishmentSaw rise up around you by the thousands.ùÑÜ Rise up by the thousands! ùÑáChorus Chorus:We greet you, OhFatherland, a thousand times! Oh Fatherland,glory to you! Your breast overflowswith joy and peace, and your radiant faceis brighter than the shining sun we see.IYour children were outraged bythe yokeThatIberianaudacity imposed on you,By the unjust and horrendous disgraceFatally weighing upon you.They cried out a holy voice to the heavens,that noble voice of a unbreakable pledge,to defeat that monster of blood,that this servile yoke would disappear.ChorusII(official verse)The firstsons ofthe soilWhichPichinchaproudly adorns,Declared you as their sovereign lady forever,And shed their blood for you.God observed and accepted theholocaust,And that blood was the prolific seedOf other heroes whom the world in astonishmentSaw rise up around you by the thousands.ChorusIIIOf those heroes of iron armNo land was invincible,And from the valley to the highestsierraYou could hear the roar of thefray.After the fray, Victory would fly,Freedom after the triumph would come,And the Lion was heard brokenWith a roar of helplessness and despair.ChorusIVAt last Spanish ferocity yielded,And now, oh Fatherland, your free existenceIs the noble and magnificent heritageWhich the felicitous heroism gave us.:It was given to us from our Fathers' hands,Let no one take it from us now,Nor any daring fool wish to exciteOur vengeful anger against himself.ChorusVMay no one, oh Fatherland, try it. The shadows ofYour glorious heroes watch us,And the valor and pride that they inspireAre omens of victories for you.Come lead and the striking iron,That the idea of war and revengeWakes the heroic strengthThat made the fierce Spanish succumb.ChorusVIAnd if new chains are prepared byThe barbaric injustice of fate,Great Pichincha! May you prevent the deathOf the Fatherland and her children in the end;Sink to the deep point in your gutAll that exists on your soil. Let the tyrantTread only ashes and in vainLook for any trace of being beside you.Chorus
