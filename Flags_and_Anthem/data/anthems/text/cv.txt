ChorusSing, brotherSing, my brotherFor Liberty is a hymnAnd Man the certainty.IWith dignity, bury the seedIn the dust of the naked islandAt the escarpment of lifeHope isAs big as the seaWhich embraces usSentinel of the oceans and windsPerseveringBetween the starsAnd the AtlanticIntone the Chant of Liberty.Chorus
